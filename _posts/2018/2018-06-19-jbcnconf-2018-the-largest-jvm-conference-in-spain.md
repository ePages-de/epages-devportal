62 talks, 16 workshops, and more than 500 attendees.
These are some of the numbers of [JBCNConf 2018](https://www.jbcnconf.com/2018/){:target="_blank"}, the largest JVM related conference in Spain.
It took place - as my header image has already revealed - in Barcelona from 11th to 13th of June.
Fortunately, I had the pleasure to attend this congress and will take this chance to lose a couple of words about my favorite sessions.

The event kicked off with a non-technical but very interesting talk about science in movies by UPC physics professor Jordi Jos√©.
In my opinion, it was a great way to break the ice and as a sci-fi fan, I particularly enjoyed this talk.

Afterwards, everyone was ready for diving into technical talks.

## Asynchronous programming with Kotlin coroutines

[Kotlin coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines.html){:target="_blank"} are a new Kotlin feature that already existed in other programming languages but which was lately introduced in Kotlin 1.1.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en-gb"><p lang="pl" dir="ltr">Konrad Kami≈Ñski is talking about asynchronous programing with kotlin! <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/jbcn18?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#jbcn18</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/kotlin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#kotlin</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/corutines?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#corutines</a> <a href="https://t.co/Kg6xQrE9Qz">pic.twitter.com/Kg6xQrE9Qz</a></p>&mdash; JBCNconf (@jbcnconf) <a href="https://twitter.com/jbcnconf/status/1006433642728558592?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">12 June 2018</a></blockquote>

It was interesting to listen to Konrad Kami≈Ñski presenting a couple of exercises to compare coroutines' performance with threads'.
To sum it up, he described coroutines as _lightweight threads_ and used some practical examples to explain how they work.

## The next evolution of microservices patterns with Istio Mesh

My favourite talk was related to [Istio](https://istio.io/){:target="_blank"}, which is a _service mesh_ solution.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en-gb"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Christian Posta (<a href="https://twitter.com/christianposta?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@christianposta</a>) in introducing us to Envoy Proxy and <a href="https://t.co/2yB3vsX3QQ">https://t.co/2yB3vsX3QQ</a> Service Mesh, discussing how they solve these problems more elegantly by pushing these concerns down to the infrastructure layer. He even have demos of how it all works! Only in <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Jbcn18?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Jbcn18</a> <a href="https://t.co/ynZNvHwnzI">pic.twitter.com/ynZNvHwnzI</a></p>&mdash; JBCNconf (@jbcnconf) <a href="https://twitter.com/jbcnconf/status/1006529110066200576?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">12 June 2018</a></blockquote>

Christian Posta elaborated on the benefits of extracting all infrastructure related concerns, such as security or api time-outs, into a specific layer above all microservices, the so-called _service mesh_.
He introduced __Istio__ as one of the solutions to implement such a layer, but pointed out that it's still under development and perhaps not completely ready for production.

## Workshops

As I mentioned in the introduction, there were also a number of workshops, which took place during the last day of the congress.
However, I personally didn't like them that much because they were quite basic, too entry level for my taste.
At least those I attended.
So hopefully, there will be some more advanced ones next year üòâ.

## Conclusion

All in all, I enjoyed my experience at JBCNConf.
I had the chance to listen to other people's opinions and experiences and compare them to mine.
Which is great!
Additionally, I met some former colleagues and enjoyed the beautiful weather and food.
