As UX experts we work with different tools to ensure an efficient working routine. Today I would like to present you my favorites and for which use case you can use them.

## Usability Testing

For Usability Testing we have two different tools in place - one for in-house usability testing and one for remote usability testing.

### Morae

Our in-house usability testing is done with [Morae](https://www.techsmith.com/morae.html). Morae provides a great set of different tools to observe, record and analyze usability tests. In our usability lab we placed two computers. One for the user and one for the moderator. On the user's computer we installed Morae recorder. It records the whole usability test: Screen, voice, face, mouse movement and when needed additional inputs. The moderator works with Morae observer so that he can see the users's screen, set markers and write notes for his observations. Depending on our testing plan additional observers can watch the usability test from another room also using the Morae observer. In the end all recordings are loaded in the Morae Manager to analyze them and prepare highlight videos for the final report and the different development teams.   

### RapidUsertests

If we quickly need test results, don't want to recruit participants ourselves or would like that the users work in their home environment, we do remote usability tests with [RapidUsertests](https://rapidusertests.com/). With RapidUsertests you can create usability tests and define characteristics for your testers. Testers fitting to your target group then test your created tasks at home. The result is also a recorded screen with voice and mouse movement. The video files we again analyze in the Morae Manager. If you like, you can also commission the RapidUsertests team to write your test scenario and tasks and to analyze the recordings.
