As UX experts we work with different tools to ensure an efficient working routine. We organize our work with tools, we need tools to complete certain tasks and sometimes they just make our lives easier. In my next two blog posts I will have a look at my favorite tools and in which UX phases and for which use cases you can use them.

## 0. Organisation

### Scrumban board in Jira

Let's start with one tool that is not exclusively for UX, but makes the organisation of our work much easier and really efficient. I don't want to miss it anymore: our Scrumban board in Jira. We work with a traditional Kanban board in Jira with the status "To do", "On hold", "In progress", "Review" and "Done". Of course we also have a full backlog with tasks.

Every week we have a replenishment meeting together with our Technical Writers and our Scrum Master. Beforehand the Product Owners of every development team submit us tasks that need to be done in the next week, e.g. as the implementation starts soon. Together with this list and our backlog, we plan the upcoming week. As a major part of our work is supporting development and therefore talking to developers and product managers, planning the week is a though job... You'll never know the amount of support talks per week. That's why we decided to have a "sprint" planning (aka replenishment), but also to drag tasks from the backlog. But when I am honest, it happens more often that one or the other task remains in the "To do" column. But here lies the strength of the board: a task never gets lost and everyone in the process is informed about the current status.

So if you also have to work with a lot of different teams and need to prioritize a lot of tasks, I recommend you to try out a Jira board that is public to your stakeholders.

## 1. User research & groundwork

Now, let's dive into the first UX phase: Every good UX concept starts with user research, competitor analysis and basic UX groundwork. Depending on the concept scope, we have different tools that can support the first phase.

### Polldaddy, SurveyMonkey and Typeform

[Polldaddy](https://polldaddy.com/) is our company tool to run surveys. It has a rather basic feature set, but you can easily conduct simple surveys to get quantitative (and qualitative) feedback from users. Conducting surveys is especially helpful, if you already have a broad understanding on the users' requirements and want to collect a high number of answers to confirm your assumptions. Moreover surveys are a great way to get feedback on different features.

Although we are mainly using Polldaddy to conduct surveys, I recommend you to have a look into SurveyMonkey. It is great for complex surveys with the need of logical links and it has a good integrated tool to analyze the results. For small surveys, I like to use Typeform as they have a really modern looking and appealing design. Small surveys are quickly done and look awesome on mobile devices.

### Recording device

A recording device may sound a little old-fashioned, but it is a great tool for accompanying field studies, like qualitative interviews or [contextual inquires](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/contextual-interviews-and-how-to-handle-them). If you record your interviews, you can easily write a protocol or transcript when you are back in your office. You don't need to note every single information and can instead concentrate on the interactions and the answers from your interview partner. This increases the quality of the talk. And if you move the recording device out of the participants view, it's quickly forgotten. For our studies we always have a dedicated recording device and don't use a mobile phone. It's feels less obtrusive and more professional.

### Post-its and index cards
{% image_lightbox image="/assets/img/pages/blog/images/postits.jpg" align="center" %}

In UX we love post-its and index cards. We have several use cases for them and most of the time our walls are full of post-its. Although I feel a little guilty about all those trees, it's often very valuable to visualize user flows and ideas on paper. It helps to get a better overview on complex structures and to discuss approaches with the team. As you can easily restructure post-its and write new ones, we use them almost in our whole UX process. Some of our major uses cases are listed below:

* Brainstorming (e.g. structure new ideas)
* User flows (e.g. how should the fist onboarding session look like)
* Cardsorting (e.g. build a information architecture)
* Notes during usability tests (e.g. write down first observations and obstacles)

Of course there also exist digital ways to e.g. do a cardsorting. [OptimalSort](https://www.optimalworkshop.com/optimalsort) comes into mind. Compared to paper index cards, it has the advantages that users at other places can contribute and that it's easier to analyze, when you have a high number of participants. However, for a simple start we always prefer the good old index cards.

### Whiteboard

Last but not least: the whiteboard! We have a whiteboard in almost every office. Sometimes it only serves as an adhesive surface for our post-its, but often it's the center of our discussions. Especially in the first groundwork phase it's great to scribble ideas on the wall to explain them e.g. to product management. Also our product managers love to draw their ideas or expected user flows on the whiteboard. Afterwards we can use the scribbles and notes to start our UX concepts.

## 2. Concept phase
Here we go, let's start with a nice an shiny concept. Or maybe, let's start with the basics and a good old pen and a sheet of paper.

### Pen & paper
In two cases I only trust in pen & paper:

1. Sort your ideas, scribble the user flow and do a first sketch. Pen and paper have the big advantage that you can't get lost in details. You automatically focus on the user flow and the general structure of the UI. It's more about getting the basics right and really get down to the problem than placing all the UI elements perfectly right.
2. The second case always takes me back in my kindergarten time and also requires further equipment like scissors and sometimes glue. You probably already know what I am talking about: A paper prototype. ....

Of course you can instead of drawing every screen also print out some wireframes. These I love to create with the next tool.     

### Balsamiq mockups


### InVision

Link everthing together

Further prototyping tools: https://developer.epages.com/blog/methods-and-tools/workflow-tuning-with-prototyping-tools/


### Atlassian confluence

Add text to explain mockups, interactions and the whole background.


## 3. Implementation

A big part of our daily routine is supporting the development teams during the implementation of the UX concepts. In this phase it's all about communication and clarification. We often give feedback, discuss details that are not defined or smaller issues that could be improved. Most of the discussions take place in meetings or directly at our desk. Also many of the already presented tools are used in the implementation phase, most important the mockups and interaction concepts in confluence. But also our beloved whiteboard is present to define some nitty-gritty details.

Besides supporting our teams, we have another role during the implementation phase. Together with our Technical Writers we provide UI texts for our products. If you want to know more about this great alliance, please have a look at Birgit's post ["Why UX and Technical Writing make a dream team"](https://developer.epages.com/blog/techcomm-and-socialmedia/why-ux-and-technical-writing-make-a-dream-team/)!

Writing UI texts is much easier (and makes much more fun), if you have the right tooling in place.

## 4. Usability Testing

For Usability Testing we have two different tools in place - one for in-house usability testing and one for remote usability testing.

### Morae
{% image_lightbox image="/assets/img/pages/blog/images/ulab.jpg" align="bottom" %}

Our in-house usability testing is done with [Morae](https://www.techsmith.com/morae.html). Morae provides a great set of different tools to observe, record and analyze usability tests. In our usability lab we placed two computers. One for the user and one for the moderator. On the user's computer we installed Morae recorder. It records the whole usability test: Screen, voice, face, mouse movement and when needed additional inputs. The moderator works with Morae observer so that he can see the users's screen, set markers and write notes for his observations. Depending on our testing plan additional observers can watch the usability test from another room also using the Morae observer. In the end all recordings are loaded in the Morae Manager to analyze them and prepare highlight videos for the final report and the different development teams.   

### RapidUsertests

If we quickly need test results, don't want to recruit participants ourselves or would like that the users work in their home environment, we do remote usability tests with [RapidUsertests](https://rapidusertests.com/). With RapidUsertests you can create usability tests and define characteristics for your testers. Testers fitting to your target group then test your created tasks at home. The result is also a screen capture including voice and mouse movement. We then analyze the video files again in Morae Manager. If you like, you can also commission the RapidUsertests team to write your test scenario and tasks and to analyze the recordings. This comes in handy if you don't have in-house usability researchers, but still would like to test your product.
