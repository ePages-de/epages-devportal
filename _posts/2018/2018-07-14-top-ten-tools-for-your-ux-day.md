As UX experts we work with different tools to ensure an efficient working routine. Today I would like to present you my favorites and for which use case you can use them.

## User research & groundwork

Every good UX concept starts with user research, competitor analysis and basic UX groundwork. Depending on the concept scope, we have different tools that can support the first phase.

### Polldaddy, SurveyMonkey and Typeform

[Polldaddy](https://polldaddy.com/) is our company tool to run surveys. It has a rather basic feature set, but you can easily conduct simple surveys to get quantitative (and qualitative) feedback from users. Conducting surveys is especially helpful, if you already have a broad understanding on the users' requirements and want to collect a high number of answers to confirm your assumptions. Moreover surveys are a great way to get feedback on different features.

Although we are mainly using Polldaddy to conduct surveys, I recommend you to have a look into SurveyMonkey. It is great for complex surveys with the need of logical links and it has a good integrated tool to analyze the results. For small surveys, I like to use Typeform as they have a really modern looking and appealing design. Small surveys are quickly done and look awesome on mobile devices.

### Recording device

A recording device may sound a little old-fashioned, but it is a great tool for accompanying field studies, like qualitative interviews or [contextual inquires](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/contextual-interviews-and-how-to-handle-them). If you record your interviews, you can easily write a protocol or transcript when you are back in your office. You don't need to note every single information and can instead concentrate on the interactions and the answers from your interview partner. This increases the quality of the talk. And if you move the recording device out of the participants view, it's quickly forgotten. For my studies I always have a dedicated recording device and don't use a mobile phone. It's feels less obtrusive and more professional.

### Post-its and index cards

In UX we love post-its and index cards. We have several use cases for them and most of the time our walls are full of post-its. Although I feel a little guilty about all those trees, it's often very valuable to visualize user flows and ideas on paper / at the wall. It helps to get a better overview on complex structures and to discuss approaches with the team. As you can easily restructure post-its and write new ones, we use them almost in our whole UX process. Some of our major uses cases are listed below:

* Brainstorming (e.g. structure new ideas)
* User flows (e.g. how should the fist onboarding session look like)
* Cardsorting (e.g. build a information architecture)
* Notes during usability tests (e.g. write down first observations and obstacles)




### Whiteboard
Last but not least the whiteboard is also a great tool in the


## UX concepts



### Pen & paper

### Balsamiq mockups

### InVision

### Atlassian confluence



## UI texts


### Terminology database

## Usability Testing

For Usability Testing we have two different tools in place - one for in-house usability testing and one for remote usability testing.

### Morae

Our in-house usability testing is done with [Morae](https://www.techsmith.com/morae.html). Morae provides a great set of different tools to observe, record and analyze usability tests. In our usability lab we placed two computers. One for the user and one for the moderator. On the user's computer we installed Morae recorder. It records the whole usability test: Screen, voice, face, mouse movement and when needed additional inputs. The moderator works with Morae observer so that he can see the users's screen, set markers and write notes for his observations. Depending on our testing plan additional observers can watch the usability test from another room also using the Morae observer. In the end all recordings are loaded in the Morae Manager to analyze them and prepare highlight videos for the final report and the different development teams.   

### RapidUsertests

If we quickly need test results, don't want to recruit participants ourselves or would like that the users work in their home environment, we do remote usability tests with [RapidUsertests](https://rapidusertests.com/). With RapidUsertests you can create usability tests and define characteristics for your testers. Testers fitting to your target group then test your created tasks at home. The result is also a screen capture including voice and mouse movement. We then analyze the video files again in Morae Manager. If you like, you can also commission the RapidUsertests team to write your test scenario and tasks and to analyze the recordings. This comes in handy if you don't have in-house usability researchers, but still would like to test your product.
