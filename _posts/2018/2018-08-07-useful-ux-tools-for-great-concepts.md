## 2. Concept phase
Here we go, let's start with a nice an shiny concept. Or maybe, let's start with the basics and a good old pen and a sheet of paper.

### Pen & paper
In two cases I only trust in pen & paper:

1. Sort your ideas, scribble the user flow and do a first sketch. Pen and paper have the big advantage that you can't get lost in details. You automatically focus on the user flow and the general structure of the UI. It's more about getting the basics right and really get down to the problem than placing all the UI elements perfectly right.
2. The second case always takes me back in my kindergarten time and also requires further equipment like scissors and sometimes glue. You probably already know what I am talking about: A paper prototype. ....

Of course you can instead of drawing every screen also print out some wireframes. These I love to create with the next tool.
