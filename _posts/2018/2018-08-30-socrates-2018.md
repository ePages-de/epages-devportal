The SoCraTes is an Open Space conference dedicated to software craft and testing.
This year, 215 participants from 17 countries gathered on the last weekend of August in Soltau, Germany.
To kickoff the (un-)conference everyone collected ideas, suggestions, and wishes in a [World Caf√©](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_caf%C3%A9).
Being an Open Space conference, the sessions were suggested each morning by the attendees and distributed across 15 tracks.
There were informal discussions, presentations, workshops, and a lot of hallway chat.
The very diverse topics ranged from Agile methodologies, to collaboration in general, to software development best practices, to web security, to games, to nail polish.

Two ePages developers joined this year's conference.
Jan participated for the first time and Oliver is already a SoCraTes regular with three attended conferences.

## Why did you go to the SoCraTes 2018?

**Oliver**:
Additionally I wanted to see how other developers keep up with cutting-edge computer science research topics and include such findings in their day-to-day work.

I pushed and contributed to an "Evil Arts of Communication" session.
... Also I wanted to "test-drive" my "How to teleport" talk.

**Jan**:
The SoCraTes was recommended to me as the best conference from two people who go to a lot of conferences.
So I was curious to find out why they are so exited about it.
Beside this I think it is a good idea in general to visit one conference per year for the sake of professional growth.

## What was your favorite session?

**Oliver**:
I was already familiar with the [OWASP Top 10]() security vulnerabilities, but I did not know, that there is a demo web shop with various vulnerability types and built-in gamification, that you can use to practice and understand the various attack vectors.
So "Hacking the Juice Shop" was definitely a highlight for me.

**Jan**:
My favorite session had the title "Broken World".
It was lead by a QA consultant who argued that life is still great even though things may be broken.
The discussion ended with the conclusion that detachment helps in coping with system failures which are unavoidable.
Another interesting insight was the observation that every crisis is also a trigger for innovation.


## Which other sessions did you attend?

**Oliver**:

**Jan**:
One of the other sessions I attended was about assessing the quality of unknown code bases.
It started with a demonstration how the different dimensions of a code base can be analyzed with Code Chalta.
Further it included tips how to approach structural problems with the Technical Dept Quadrant model and a list of static analysis tools.

The others were about soft skills like taking sketch notes, the human factors of software development, and self-care.

Also I lead two sessions by myself.
One was a discussion about approaches for learning new technologies.
The other was a presentation of the architectural prototype of a personal open-source project of mine.


## What key learnings do you want to apply in the near future?

**Oliver**:

**Jan**:
Inspired by the "Broken World" session I'll try to improve spending my energy to fix the right things and accept those beyond my control.

From the conversations beside the session I could derive a lot of ideas, e.g. trying out the Google Design Sprint concept during a Hackathon and digging deeper into the Hexagonal Architecture model.

Also I'll try out some of the static analysis tools recommended in the "Unknown Code Base Quality" session, i.e. Code Chalta, OWASP Dependency Check, codemmat, and Structure 101.


## What was your biggest surprise?

**Oliver**:

**Jan**:
Having gender neutral bathrooms didn't feel so weird like anticipated.

## Any advice for SoCraTes newcomers?

**Oliver**:
Reach out to as many people as possible and try to attend plenty of sessions!
If you are unhappy with how a session evolved, use the [Law of Two Feet]() and try to contribute somewhere else!
Always sit with different people!
Most of all: be prepared to be surprised!

**Jan**:
Before you go to the conference, think about what you want to learn.
