The SoCraTes is an Open Space conference dedicated to software craft and testing.
This year, 215 participants from 17 countries gathered on the last weekend of August in Soltau, Germany.
To kickoff the (un-)conference everyone collected ideas, suggestions, and wishes in a [World Caf√©](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_caf%C3%A9).
Being an Open Space conference, the sessions were suggested each morning by the attendees and distributed across 15 tracks.
There were informal discussions, presentations, workshops, and a lot of hallway chat.
The very diverse topics ranged from Agile methodologies, to collaboration in general, to software development best practices, to web security, to games, to nail polish.

Two ePages developers joined this year's conference.
Jan participated for the first time and Oliver is already a SoCraTes regular with three attended conferences.

## Why did you go to the SoCraTes 2018?

**Oliver**:
Additionally I wanted to see how other developers keep up with cutting-edge computer science research topics and include such findings in their day-to-day work.

I pushed and contributed to an "Evil Arts of Communication" session.
... Also I wanted to "test-drive" my "How to teleport" talk.

## What was your favorite session?

**Oliver**:
I was already familiar with the [OWASP Top 10]() security vulnerabilities, but I did not know, that there is a demo web shop with various vulnerability types and built-in gamification, that you can use to practice and understand the various attack vectors.
So "Hacking the Juice Shop" was definitely a highlight for me.

## Which other sessions did you attend?

**Oliver**:

## What key learnings do you want to apply in the near future?

**Oliver**:

## What was your biggest surprise?

**Oliver**:

## Any advice for SoCraTes newcomers?

**Oliver**:
Reach out to as many people as possible and try to attend plenty of sessions!
If you are unhappy with how a session evolved, use the [Law of Two Feet]() and try to contribute somewhere else!
Always sit with different people!
Most of all: be prepared to be surprised!
