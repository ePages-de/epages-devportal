Hamburg is not only a Free and Hanseatic City, the second-largest city of Germany,  it is also a nice place where a lot of interesting events and conferences are happening. Like the JeffConf, the event I was recently attending. The conference was fully dedicated to "serverless" architecture. Yet another buzzword becoming more and more popular nowadays.

That was I perfect place where people with different perspectives were got together to talk about "serverless" architectire, share their experience of implementation and gotchas.

Thanks to organizers of the event, I was enjoing interesting talks the whole day long.

Such events are great choise for those who want trim the sails to the wind. In other words, want to be aware about modern practices in the software achitecture. But it is not usually sufficient enough because every new approach you want to try has a number of limitations which are not noticable from the beginning and may be critical for a problem you software is trying to solve. Knowing the limitations of technology you use is always helps to build better system.

Manu Rink shared her opinion with the comunity when you should not use serverless approach:

Another speaker, Yan Cui, shared his successful experience of using serverless approach, helping to cut operations budget dramatically:

It is not a secret, that popularity of a technology is also influenced by the frameworks and tools building an environment around it. The most important framework, as for me, which helps developers be productive and manage a lifecycle of their serverless application is ...  [serverless](https://github.com/serverless/serverless){:target="_blank"}

I believe with the  In the nearest Hackatton which is happening in ePages on regular basis there will be a nice use-case where serverless architecture principles can be applied.
Looking forward to trying serverless!
