Folks, board games are pretty darn cool.
And winter is on the horizon.
What could be better to eliminate the winter blues than gathering together with your colleagues, and cuddle up for a board game night?
Just recently we did exactly that!
We brought our favourite board games, occupied our big conference room, and ordered pizza.

### Let the games begin

After a short kicker session, we decided to play Werewolf.
It took some time to explain the rules of the game to all participants, but it was so much fun at the same time.
Laughter definitely included.
Our narrator made up a nice story, and led us through the game.
After the first round we all wanted to play again.
At the same time the degree of difficulty was increased.
There were not only werewolves and citizens among us, but also an oracle.
No problem for us.

### On it goes

We then split up into groups to devote ourselves to other games that we had brought with us.
And just pizza was apparently not enough, so we had to top off with nibbles to keep our game minds active ðŸ˜€.
(We compensated all the sugar the next day by taking fruits from our fruit basked twice ðŸ˜‰.)

One group chose to play Codenames.
And that even under difficult conditions, because it was the English version.

While the Codename gamers had to behave rather thoughtfully and quietly, the next table was a party.
They played Cash'n Guns very vividly, and enjoyed the fun.

### Games! Give us more games!

We had a blast and decided that the next board game night is already set.
Are there games we have to try next time?
