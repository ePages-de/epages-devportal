This weekend I had the chance to spend a great time with great people, learn something new and get some inspiration on the [Jeeconf](https://jeeconf.com){:target="_blank"} in Kyiv.
I have to admit that I was a bit sceptical when buying the ticket in advance with no fully defined schedule, but it turned out to be very interesting from the content perspective and very well organized.

The conference is promoted as the largest Java conference in Eastern Europe.
Despite this location, it was still possible to find a number of interesting talks in English.

I personally enjoyed the talks given by the guys from [Pivotal](https://pivotal.io){:target="_blank"}.
[Juergen Hoeller](https://twitter.com/springjuergen){:target="_blank"} gave an overview of the Spring framework evolution over the last fifteen years, starting from the very beginning, and partly covering the release schedule for 2018.
[Josh Long](https://twitter.com/starbuxman){:target="_blank"} gave a "bootiful" talk showing the audience how easy it is to start prototyping with Spring Boot and how concise and shiny Kotlin code can look like.

At ePages we also have experience using Kotlin, even in production.
This powerful language is happily used by several scrum teams for the development of backend microservices.
That's why I had a personal interest in tracks related to Kotlin.

Thanks to the presentation of [Dmitry Jemerov](https://twitter.com/intelliyole){:target="_blank"}, Principal Engineer at [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com){:target="_blank"}, everyone who has attended his talk now knows about the possibility to use Kotlin in multi-platform projects.
I believe that these strategic steps will increase the amount of developers working with Kotlin in a long run and expand it's area of application.

I was also excited to visit the so called ["Birds of a feather"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birds_of_a_feather_%28computing%29){:target="_blank"} (BOF) with a very noticeable title "Kotlin: new silver bullet or the future".
Here, everyone had the chance to ask questions, not only related to the programming language, but also about the company standing behind it.
The BOF session was prolonged due to the high interest of the audience who rose questions pretty actively.
This meeting format is a great opportunity for everyone to get an easy access to the key people of the software industry and get some insights and details about key decisions made in the past, as well as plans for future.

It was a great time, and I'm looking forward to the next year!
