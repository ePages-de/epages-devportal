62 talks, 16 workshops and more than 500 attendees. These are some of the numbers of [JBCN Conf 2018](https://www.jbcnconf.com/2018/){:target="_blank"}, the largest JVM related conference in Spain which took place in Barcelona on 11th-13th of June. Fortunately I had the pleasure to attend the congress so I will use this article to say a couple words about my favourite sessions.

The event kicked off with a non-technical but very interesting talk about science in movies by UPC physics professor Jordi Jos√©. I thought it was a great way to break the ice and as sci-fi fan I particularly enjoyed this talk.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en-gb"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Jordi Jose explains in the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/jbcn18?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#jbcn18</a> talk ‚ÄúSurfing through Spacetime‚Äù why you shouldn‚Äôt trust Bruce Willis when it comes to science in movies üòÇ <a href="https://t.co/BU5iqNikmi">pic.twitter.com/BU5iqNikmi</a></p>&mdash; JBCNconf (@jbcnconf) <a href="https://twitter.com/jbcnconf/status/1006085056392257536?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">11 June 2018</a></blockquote>

Afterwards everyone was ready for getting into technical talks.

## Asynchronous programming with Kotlin coroutines

[Kotlin coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines.html){:target="_blank"} are a new Kotlin feature that already existed in other programming languages but were introduced in Kotlin 1.1. Coroutines are usually

It was interesting to hear Konrad Kami≈Ñski presenting a couple of exercises to compare coroutines' performance with threads'. To sum up, he described coroutines as _lightweight threads_ and used some practical examples to explain how they work.

## The next evolution of microservices patterns with Istio Mesh

My favourite talk was related to [Istio](https://istio.io/){:target="_blank"}, which is a _service mesh_ solution.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en-gb"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Christian Posta (<a href="https://twitter.com/christianposta?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@christianposta</a>) in introducing us to Envoy Proxy and <a href="https://t.co/2yB3vsX3QQ">https://t.co/2yB3vsX3QQ</a> Service Mesh, discussing how they solve these problems more elegantly by pushing these concerns down to the infrastructure layer. He even have demos of how it all works! Only in <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Jbcn18?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Jbcn18</a> <a href="https://t.co/ynZNvHwnzI">pic.twitter.com/ynZNvHwnzI</a></p>&mdash; JBCNconf (@jbcnconf) <a href="https://twitter.com/jbcnconf/status/1006529110066200576?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">12 June 2018</a></blockquote>

Christian Posta, the speaker, elaborated on the benefits of extracting all infrastructure related concerns, such as security or api time-outs, into a specific layer above all micro-services, the so-called _service mesh_. Later, he introduced __Istio__ as one of the solutions that implement such layer, making clear that it's still under development and perhaps not completely ready for production.

## Workshops

As I mentioned in the introduction, there were also a number of workshops, which took place the last day of the congress. However, I must say I didn't like them that much because there were too basic, too entry level for my taste, at least those I attended. I would have liked to participate in more advanced workshops.

## Conclusion

All in all I enjoyed my experience at JBCNConf. I had the chance to listen to other people's opinions and experiences and compare them to mine. Additionally I met some former colleagues and enjoyed the beautiful weather and food.
