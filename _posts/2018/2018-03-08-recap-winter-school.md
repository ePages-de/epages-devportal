Once a year, twelve young UX professionals from all across Germany gather in the idyllic Taubertal, more precisely in the monastery Bronnbach, to exchange views and experiences, to make new contacts and to enlarge their expert knowledge.
Who is responsible for this gathering?

Initiator is the [German UPA](https://www.germanupa.de/), the association for professionals working in the domain of usability and user experience.
Behind this stands a growing network of UX experts, who support employees in regard to their daily user-centered work, who engage in specific UX-related topics, such as user research or quality standard, and who represent the whole bunch of UX topics to the general public.

Some of their 15.000 members are especially engaged in junior development and tadaa: One day, the idea of the so called Winter School was born.
This year, I was one of the happy 12 chosen participants - Hooray!

## Perfect learning environment

The conditions for our two intensive days of workshops were simply fantastic.
The housing next to the monastery was really beautiful, the staff was very cordial and courteous and not to forget: the vinothek!
Especially for "UX evangelists", the monastery is of course the place to be for training sessions üòá.

A special thanks goes to Ludwig Fichte, Senior User Researcher bei [SAP SE](https://www.sap.com/corporate/de.html).
He headed us competently through the days and moderated in between the workshops.


## It's all about the right mix of methods

Maria H√§ndler, UX Consultant at [m-pathy GmbH](https://www.m-pathy.com/de/), made the glorious start.
She introduced us to the topic of **Live User Tracking**.
Although many people might assume, this is not about simply reading out click counts ‚òùÔ∏è.
The secret lies in the right mix of quantitative and qualitative methods!
Let's take a high cancellation rate at a specific spot in a system as an example.
When doing user tracking in your system, you can read out the exact number of cancellations.
In fact, this number doesn't tell you anything but that there goes something wrong.
So the second step, a qualitative one, should be to have a look into the individual user sessions in order to identify the different reasons for the high rate of cancellations.
Based on this knowledge, the data of cancellation can then be limited to the single problems and quantified again.
Like this, you prioritize the problems and further work on them.

As our devs at ePages are currently working on implementing user tracking in our new software, I am curious about sharing my insights with my colleagues.

Kilian J√§ger, Senior Usability Engineer at [1&1 Telekom GmbH](https://unternehmen.1und1.de/impressum/), continued with a workshop about **Service Design Thinking**.
Although the first hype about design thinking seems to be almost cooled down, it is still highly topical and so, so useful - not only in the daily work as a UX Manager.
This workshop impressively demonstrated how a vague idea can turn into a cool and innovative product vision, by simply using the right mix of methods.
In our case, this mix consisted of an experience interview, the development of a persona, sketching a customer journey map, brainstorming and formulating a design challenge.
A "movie match" - the Tinder of tomorrow's TV culture.
Why not?!


## With 6-3-5 on your way to the breakthrough

After a practical workshop headed by Frederik Bader, Usability Engineer at [Verivox GmbH](), about little tips and tricks using the prototyping tool Axure, Christian Grieger und Sven Fackert (UX Manager and UX Researcher at Ergosign GmbH), made the great final.
Have you ever asked yourself how to pimp your dusty existing product, but did not get to innovative ideas so far?
The secret could lie in a structured brainstorming session.
Many brainstormings culminate in broad discussions which do not lead to any results.
A method, like [6-3-5 Brainwriting](), could remedy.
This is not your problem?
But to convince your chef to invest into rebuilding the product in order to simplify a complex user flow?
Then, you could try out [GOMS](), a model based evaluation method.
It enables you predict how long it will take an experienced user in your software to complete a task with no errors.
Then simply do the same calculation for the optimized user flow and your chef will see that the effort is worth it.
It is as easy as it sounds!
Let's just try it out :)

## So many like-minded people

What I especially liked was to have so many like-minded people at one place.
There has been a lively exchange of UX-related topics:
* What are future key topics at the UX firmament?
* What are the main issues companies need to deal with?
* What are challenges?
* How are team structures and how can UX be included in development processes?

What I find remarkable again and again and what I am proud of, is the fact that UX professionals are loyal.
They care A LOT about the prduct they currently work for. They are driven by make it the best product it can be.
They feel responsible.
And they are willing to invest effort to lead all product makers towards one shared direction.
The direction of the user.
This can, I guess, sometimes appear exhausting - But this is only, let's say, for the good cause :)


## Hoping for a Spring School to come

All in all I can say, that the two says Winter School got several things moving:
I got to know an increadible amount of methods that I'd like to try out in practice.
I got to know great people and insights in other UX peoples' businesses.
I now have a long lists of books I definitively want to read.
So all in all, I feel motivated and inspired :)
I went home from the beautiful Taubertal - not only with three bottles of wine and a Usability quartet, but with anticipation for what I will meet on my journey as a UX Manager.
How about - for example - a "Spring School"? ;-)
