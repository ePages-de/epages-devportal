Remember that I promised you to reveal more about the work of my UX colleagues?
The day has come!
When I learnt what [UX is about](/blog/ux-and-design/do-you-know-what-ux-is-about/), I was curious what an average working day of our UX experts would look like.<br>
In a nutshell: there's no average.
Every day is different.
Varied and exciting rather than humdrum.

Apart from their morning routine, maybe ðŸ˜‰.

#### 8:00 am

Anja gets herself some water, checks her emails and the team's JIRA board to see what's up for the day.

#### 8:30 am

Focus time!
If there's no early UI text session, Anja can concentrate on her scheduled tasks.
Later in the day this becomes difficult, as colleagues check back on UX concepts, bring up questions, or discuss stuff.

#### 9:25 am

Lena enters the office.
She quickly grabs a coffee, and her day shoots off.

#### 9:30 am

It's time for the daily.
Together with the other teammates, Anja and Lena quickly go through yesterday's tasks, and what's scheduled for the day.
Afterwards, they might make some quick arrangements and scheduling together with their Scrum Master.

#### 9:40 am

The ladies have 20 minutes for alignments or last meeting preparations.

#### 10:00 am

Usually, the meeting marathon starts off at 10.
If it's a UX meeting, PM meeting, UI text session, roadmap meetings or development team review - there's no time to breathe until lunch.

#### 12:00 am

Around 12 am the stomach rumbles.
Time for a lunch break.
If the weather is nice, they grab something from one of the many restaurants around and have a picnic in the park or go for a walk.
If not, our social room is also a great choice for lunch.

But Thursdays are different.
Anja attends lunch yoga.
An awesome distraction from the busy morning.

#### 1:00 pm

The afternoon starts as varied as the morning.
If they are lucky, our UX ladies have some focus time for their scheduled tasks.
Or there are periods, where they have time blockers to plan and conduct usability tests.
Or they sit together and discuss UX concepts, do research or contextual inquiries.
If they get stuck on something or need advice, they go over to our designers and ask them to walk through the issue with together.

#### 2:00 pm

Once all the teams are back from lunch, the office gets crowded again.
This means, it's time for the next meetings.
This can be discussions about help center articles, alignments with the product owners, arranging UX requirements or clarifying implementation queries from our designers.

#### 3:30 pm

Time to quickly gather with some colleagues at the favorite coffee shop to grab a soy latte or almond cappuccino.
Yummy!

#### 3:45 pm

The coffee cup still in hand, this is a good time for Anja and Lena to meet with their UI writing colleague.
There's work to do on aligning UI texts and style guidelines, scheduling next steps, and thinking about the big picture.

Every month, this will perhaps be the time to discuss topics to show in their team review and preparing the slides accordingly.

#### 5:30 pm

Anja says goodbye, and heads towards the train station to enjoy the evening at home.
Whereas Lena takes the advantage of the calmer office hours to tackle her scheduled tasks.

#### 7:00 pm

Time for Lena to switch the light off and go home.

#### Boring job? No way!

As I said in the teaser, every day is different.
And this makes the job exciting and colorful.
Communication is king in the life of my UX colleagues.
And a robust attitude towards meetings, as well as enough patience to survive a meeting marathon week is required on a UXers' set card.
