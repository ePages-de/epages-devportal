In the [first part](/blog/language-and-localization/why-the-heck-would-we-need-a-software-localization-tool/) of this series, you got an introduction to our initial localization process.
And you dived deeper into the challenges we met to improve it.
This part will cover the journey towards a localization tool.

## Discovery tours for the win

The findings from the evaluation of the localization have been a great starting point.
It was obvious, that we need to introduce a localization tool.
But which one?
There are plenty of them on the market.
Each of them declares to be the best and most useful one.
And not to forget the different pricing and features.
There was only one way to tackle this: A second discovery tour.
So I talked to Product owners, UI writers, UX experts, developers, and colleagues from HR, Marketing and Sales.
To sum it up: To everyone who gets somehow in touch with translations.
I tried to figure out their needs and wishes concerning a localization tool.

## The rating list

The discovery tour ended up in a prioritized list of feature wishes:

1.*In-Context editor*   
Translators cannot provide high-quality translations without context.
But the manual effort to provide screenshots for every key is very high.
With an In-Context editor, you can directly translate the keys in the UI.
Thus, it would eliminate the manual effort to 0 by providing 100 % context.

2.*Git Synchronization*   
Our developers should be able to focus on their main task: Developing.
The effort to get the keys translated should by as low as possible for them.
That's why we were looking for a tool that can be integrated into their workflow and that is compatible to their tools.

3.*Translation Memory*   
A translations memory can serve our needs in three ways:
Our internal UI writers get support when creating new UI texts.
They can easily check how they worded similar phrases before, and if they can simply reuse the old wording.
Additionally, it helps them to choose a consistent wording.
And last but not least: Nobody would like to pay a translation agency for translating the exact same sentence they did already before.

4.*Glossary*   
We already had a terminology databank in place.
The entries of this database should also be used in the localization tool.
This way, our internal UI writers and translators will speak one language and use a fixed set of terms.

Besides this feature list, we also had an eye on the overall feature set, the pricing, available users, and key limitations.
What can I say?
It wasn't an easy decision.
There are plenty of tools out there and we could have worked with most of them.
But some test accounts and discussions later, we decided to go with PhraseApp.

## So far so good

We've decided which tool we want to go with.
Great!
But that's where the party starts.
