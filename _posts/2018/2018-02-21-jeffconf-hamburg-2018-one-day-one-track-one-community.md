Hamburg is not only a Free and Hanseatic City, the second-largest city of Germany, it is also a nice place where a lot of interesting events, and conferences take place.
Such as the [JeffConf](https://hamburg.jeffconf.com/){:target="_blank"} I recently attended.
The conference was fully dedicated to "serverless" architecture.
Yet another buzzword becoming more and more popular nowadays.

That was a perfect place where people with different perspectives gathered together to talk about "serverless" architecture, share their experience of implementation, and gotchas.

Thanks to the organizers of the event, I enjoyed interesting talks during the whole day.

Such events are great a occasion for those who want trim the sails to the wind.
In other words, for those want to be aware about modern practices in the software architecture.
But it is usually not sufficient enough because every new approach you want to try has a number of limitations which are not noticeable from the beginning, and may be critical for a problem your software is trying to solve. Knowing the limitations of technology you use always helps to build better system.

I have attended the number of talks, but the following are the most mentionable, as those are the ones I'd like to also share with my team.

Manu Rink shared her opinion with the community when you should not use serverless approach:

Another speaker, Yan Cui, shared his successful experience of using the serverless approach, helping to cut operations budget dramatically:

It is not a secret, that the popularity of a technology is also influenced by the frameworks, and tools building an environment around it.
For me, the most noticeable framework, which helps developers to be productive, and to manage a lifecycle of their serverless application is ...  [serverless](https://github.com/serverless/serverless){:target="_blank"}.

I believe with the upcoming ePages [hackathon](/blog/events/epages-hackathon-2017/), there will be a nice use case, where serverless architecture principles can be applied.

Looking forward to trying serverless!
