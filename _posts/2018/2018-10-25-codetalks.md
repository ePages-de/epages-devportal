Once a year ...

## Olli's notes

1. "Software-QualitÃ¤t === Gesundheit" - Roland Golla (never code alone)

* Focus on good software, good code base quality not just for your users or professional sake, but for the sake of your health as well!
* Without fun, you cannot do creative work
* Automation lifts your spirit!
* At the end it is good for business too: less developer turn-over, more deployments and only prod deployments make $$$, faster time to market
* Work together, do not take work home, get into the flow and have fun!

---

2. "Service Workers: The Technology Behind Progressive Web Apps" - Felix Gessert (Baqend)

* Learned about manifest.json to configure a PWA
* Learned how to preload website contents using service workers, events and lifetime
* Learned some restrictions on service workers (current directory scope)
* Learned about service worker cache

-> will def. try to create a PWA!

3. "Mit dem Fahrrad gegen die Wand fahren" - Nils Langner (Leankoala) + Marcel Semmler (Bauer Xcel Media)

* Premise: Most projects fail, your projects included
* Hypothesis: rather fail early and often, then failing late and expensive

Key findings:

* Pick a good name, that people can find (written the same way it is spoken)
* User usually use only 20% of an application's features

* You need problems, not solutions
* "Jobs to be done"
* Value proposition design
* Design sprint

TALK TO USERS! (5 interviews, 30 - 60 min each are enough)

* Try paper prototypes! (might get more honest feedback)
* Paper -> wireframe -> clickdummy prototype
* Crowd test! Try kickstarter!
* "Usability lunch"



I gained more from last year's technical and management talks. But it is still nice to meet with the developer community once a year and recognize regulars!
