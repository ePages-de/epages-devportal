Code Talks is one of the largest developer conferences in Europe. It takes place once a year and ePages developers regularly participate and enjoy the event. The conference takes place in a cinema where all attendees are provided with a free popcorn and cola.
It lasted two days with various and exciting topics on different themes distributed across ten tracks. A broad range of topics covered IT Management, DevOps, Security, Backend and Frontend Development, Software Architecture, and UX Design.
It is a good opportunity to talk with other developers from different companies, share work and life experience, learn something new, have fun and dance at the  evening party.

## All your money belongs to us - Denis Hamann

* App hacking

## Live a happier life with a pull request everyday - Felix Eckhardt

* PR should be small: big PR is hard to review, issues can be skipped and eventually bring failures in the system that hard to reveal
* Split task into smaller tasks
* Small PRs let to delivery quickly, avoid big amount of merge conflicts and not to lose a track of the story and motivation.
* Small PRs bring self satisfaction: small victory every day.

## Olli's notes

1. "Software-Qualität === Gesundheit" - Roland Golla (never code alone)

* Focus on good software, good code base quality not just for your users or professional sake, but for the sake of your health as well!
* Without fun, you cannot do creative work
* Automation lifts your spirit!
* At the end it is good for business too: less developer turn-over, more deployments and only prod deployments make $$$, faster time to market
* Work together, do not take work home, get into the flow and have fun!

2. "Service Workers: The Technology Behind Progressive Web Apps" - Felix Gessert (Baqend)

* Learned about manifest.json to configure a PWA
* Learned how to preload website contents using service workers, events and lifetime
* Learned some restrictions on service workers (current directory scope)
* Learned about service worker cache

-> will def. try to create a PWA!

3. "Mit dem Fahrrad gegen die Wand fahren" - Nils Langner (Leankoala) + Marcel Semmler (Bauer Xcel Media)

* Premise: Most projects fail, your projects included
* Hypothesis: rather fail early and often, then failing late and expensive

Key findings:

* Pick a good name, that people can find (written the same way it is spoken)
* User usually use only 20% of an application's features

* You need problems, not solutions
* "Jobs to be done"
* Value proposition design
* Design sprint

TALK TO USERS! (5 interviews, 30 - 60 min each are enough)

* Try paper prototypes! (might get more honest feedback)
* Paper -> wireframe -> clickdummy prototype
* Crowd test! Try kickstarter!
* "Usability lunch"

## Summary
For us the conference was not only an event with interesting talks and tasty food but it also influenced on our personal impression of what we are doing in the company. We are more convinced that we are moving in the right direction by choosing microservices architecture (https://microservices.io/) approach, applying
Event Driven Design (https://martinfowler.com/articles/201701-event-driven.html) in the service communication in order to improve scalability and data reconciliation and using the stack of popular technologies that helped also other companies to improve their business and development process. It was very interesting to know their opinion and experience and compare with ours.
We enjoyed the event and looking forward to take part the next year.

- We are on the right tracks
-
- usage the stack of popular technologies
- common microservices architecture approach: Event Driven Design is used to produce highly scalable applications (https://martinfowler.com/articles/201701-event-driven.html), event logging, data reconciliation, Helm for services orchestration.
- clusterization
- With single data source, it’s way much easier to guaranty that given entity have the same state across the system.
- Spreading data is across multiple microservices
- Kotlin/Java

I gained more from last year's technical and management talks. But it is still nice to meet with the developer community once a year and recognize regulars!
