In the last part of our series about using the right tools for different UX phases, the implementation phase is in the spotlight.
A big part of our daily routine is supporting the development teams during the implementation of the UX concepts.
In this phase it's all about communication and clarification.
We often give feedback, discuss details that are not defined, or come up with smaller issues that can be improved.
Most of the discussions take place in meetings or directly at our desk.

Many of the tools that we have presented in our posts ["User research and UX groundwork"](/blog/ux-and-design/useful-ux-tools-for-research-and-groundwork/) and ["UX concepts made easy with the right tools"](/blog/ux-and-design/ux-concepts-made-easy-with-the-right-tools/) we do use in the during implementation as well, most importantly the mockups and interaction concepts in Confluence.
Our beloved whiteboard is also present to define some nitty-gritty details.
But, there's more that helps us in the implementation phase of our concepts.

## Getting user interface texts right

Besides supporting our teams, we have another role during the implementation phase.
Together with our Technical Writers we provide UI texts for our products.
If you want to know more about this great alliance, have a look at Birgit's post ["Why UX and Technical Writing make a dream team"](/blog/techcomm-and-socialmedia/why-ux-and-technical-writing-make-a-dream-team/)!

Crafting UI texts is much easier (and much more fun), if you have the right tooling in place.

### Terminology database

Our internal terminology database is a great support for us when it comes to using terms that have already been defined, and thus creating consistent UI texts.

We've put quite some initial effort into setting up this database.
It involved a lot of research, discussions, and agreements in advance, but the effort was absolutely worth it!
Our head can only remember limited terms that we defined and agreed months or even years ago.
It's a lot easier for us to ask the database and easily find out the right one as all of the entries come with definitions, context, and screenshots. 

### PhraseApp

Our localization tool is worth its weight in gold.
It not only helps us to have our software translated into other languages, but it is also a great support when it comes to creating the source texts.
Once the development teams have implemented our UX concepts, we have access to the preliminary texts from our mockups in PhraseApp.
This way, we can see the texts in their entire context directly in the user interface, and we can adapt them or create new phrases uniformly.
What's more, the tool shows us matching terminology so that we don't have to reinvent the wheel.

## Usability testing

For Usability Testing we have two different tools in place - one for in-house usability testing and one for remote usability testing.

### Morae

Our in-house usability testing is done with [Morae](https://www.techsmith.com/morae.html){:target="_blank"}. Morae provides a great set of different tools to observe, record and analyze usability tests. In our usability lab we placed two computers. One for the user and one for the moderator. On the user's computer we installed Morae recorder. It records the whole usability test: Screen, voice, face, mouse movement and when needed additional inputs. The moderator works with Morae observer so that he can see the users's screen, set markers and write notes for his observations. Depending on our testing plan additional observers can watch the usability test from another room also using the Morae observer. In the end all recordings are loaded in the Morae Manager to analyze them and prepare highlight videos for the final report and the different development teams.   

### RapidUsertests

If we quickly need test results, don't want to recruit participants ourselves or would like that the users work in their home environment, we do remote usability tests with [RapidUsertests](https://rapidusertests.com/){:target="_blank"}. With RapidUsertests you can create usability tests and define characteristics for your testers. Testers fitting to your target group then test your created tasks at home. The result is also a screen capture including voice and mouse movement. We then analyze the video files again in Morae Manager. If you like, you can also commission the RapidUsertests team to write your test scenario and tasks and to analyze the recordings. This comes in handy if you don't have in-house usability researchers, but still would like to test your product.
