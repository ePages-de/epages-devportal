Phew.
I didn't.
Until now.
I was curious, so I met for a coffee with our UX Managers here at ePages.
Where did they get their superpower?
And what is it that makes UX such a buzzword these days?

## Where it all begins

Our Usability Expert Anja holds a Master in Media and Communication Science.
This course of studies has many interfaces with UX, e.g. psychology or design, but also sets great focus on user research.
It also covers a broad spectrum of human-machine interaction topics, and combines content from the fields of economic sciences and law.

Also for Lena, our UX Manager, interdisciplinary orientation was key in her studies.
She has a Master in Information Science.
The content of her study courses is also very varied: linguistics, communication, online marketing, human-machine interaction, computer science...
Being a bit worried about what to do with all these different areas, the professors always reassured them "Don't worry. You will be the perfect interface!"

## Talking about interfaces

I was wondering which departments and teams they closely work with within the company.
It's a hell of a lot - if not all.
Anja and Lena both belong to the Product Management team.
Sure thing, they have close contact with all Product Managers, as well as the Product Owners.
And of course, they have a core functionality within the Research and Development team, which means supporting all software development teams, namely Designers, Frontend Developers, and Backend Developers.
For optimum product placement, they also talk a lot with Marketing and Sales, as well as with Customer Support and Service Center to manage and include customer feedback.

## Embracing change.. ugh.. challenges

I have a gut feeling that collaborating with so many different departments is not always rose-colored.
And the ladies confirmed it: doing the groundwork for so many different teams makes it hard to keep up in terms of communication, accompanying the UX processes, and being agile.
UXers have so many awesome ideas that can make our customer's heart skip a beat.
But putting these ideas into practice is quite challenging, as it has to be aligned with other company priorities and resource planning.

## There is nothing like usability

I grin, because besides this, I totally feel that they're in love with what they are able to create.
And when I directly ask them, what UX means to them, Anja and Lena unanimously answered:
"The key for user experience is usability."

Let's talk facts: UX goes far beyond that.
For our UX Managers, the aim of UX is to make the moment of use special.
Our customers should enjoy using our product, they should be able to work with it in a focused and goal-oriented manner without having the product itself blocking them.

Their statement is pretty clear: everybody should create user-friendly products. And: don't just develop the product further, but also it's experience.

My bottom line: if you have UXers in the company, your product gets the icing on the cake.

## UX in ecommerce - a special thing?

As we live and breathe ecommerce at ePages, I am wondering if UX work for the online business is a special thing.

Not really, I learn.
Sure, online shops do have special UX and interaction patterns.
For example, you expect the cart in an online shop always at the top right.
And two target groups are involved: the merchant, who works with the software, and their customers, who shall buy in the actual online shop.
But in general, it matches with the common psychological and cognitive requirements.

## Hand on heart

From what I learnt during the talk with our UX ladies, I doubt that everybody in the company knows, what UX is about.

They definitely got me interested.
And I want to know more about user experience.
Stay tuned.
