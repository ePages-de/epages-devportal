## 3. Implementation

A big part of our daily routine is supporting the development teams during the implementation of the UX concepts. In this phase it's all about communication and clarification. We often give feedback, discuss details that are not defined or smaller issues that could be improved. Most of the discussions take place in meetings or directly at our desk. Also many of the already presented tools are used in the implementation phase, most important the mockups and interaction concepts in confluence. But also our beloved whiteboard is present to define some nitty-gritty details.

Besides supporting our teams, we have another role during the implementation phase. Together with our Technical Writers we provide UI texts for our products. If you want to know more about this great alliance, please have a look at Birgit's post ["Why UX and Technical Writing make a dream team"](https://developer.epages.com/blog/techcomm-and-socialmedia/why-ux-and-technical-writing-make-a-dream-team/)!

Writing UI texts is much easier (and makes much more fun), if you have the right tooling in place.

## 4. Usability Testing

For Usability Testing we have two different tools in place - one for in-house usability testing and one for remote usability testing.

### Morae

Our in-house usability testing is done with [Morae](https://www.techsmith.com/morae.html). Morae provides a great set of different tools to observe, record and analyze usability tests. In our usability lab we placed two computers. One for the user and one for the moderator. On the user's computer we installed Morae recorder. It records the whole usability test: Screen, voice, face, mouse movement and when needed additional inputs. The moderator works with Morae observer so that he can see the users's screen, set markers and write notes for his observations. Depending on our testing plan additional observers can watch the usability test from another room also using the Morae observer. In the end all recordings are loaded in the Morae Manager to analyze them and prepare highlight videos for the final report and the different development teams.   

### RapidUsertests

If we quickly need test results, don't want to recruit participants ourselves or would like that the users work in their home environment, we do remote usability tests with [RapidUsertests](https://rapidusertests.com/). With RapidUsertests you can create usability tests and define characteristics for your testers. Testers fitting to your target group then test your created tasks at home. The result is also a screen capture including voice and mouse movement. We then analyze the video files again in Morae Manager. If you like, you can also commission the RapidUsertests team to write your test scenario and tasks and to analyze the recordings. This comes in handy if you don't have in-house usability researchers, but still would like to test your product.
