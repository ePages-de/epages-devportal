We've been working on a new backend architecture for quite a while now, which is in a certain way exhausting, as we have to maintain and develop two products with very little synergy.
So, why do we go this extra mile here at ePages?

## Environment changes fast

The IT world changed drastically in the last years as the speed of adoption seems to increase logarithmic.
Software vendors focus more and more on their core functionalities.
That allows them to specialize and become best-in-class in their specific segment.

### Approaches to bridge the gap

But when you cut functionality down to the core - you need to get the "topping" from somewhere else.
So, the down side of this evolution is that you need to integrate these toppings.
The easiest way to do so, is via APIs - more or less standardized interfaces, which allow systems to talk to each other and thus enrich your core systems with additional functionalities.

### The past was different

As many other companies, ePages started the millennium with a monolith approach that we enhanced and enriched over time.
This means that we at the end offered some awkward functions like a holiday-appartment reservation tool - although being an ecommerce system.
That way our old stack became overloaded and lead to many dependencies.
Our monolith became more and more complicated to maintain, and we started spending too much time on keeping stuff running instead of creating business value!
Although it delivers good performance and is still heavily used and liked by our merchants, it's architecture is definitely outdated.

### New architecture needed

Thus, our goal was to build a developer-friendly platform, that is easy to change and to maintain.
We want to focuses on our core functionality - ecommerce - and get the above-mentioned toppings from other specialists.
That's why we've decided to go with an "API-first" approach, which allows us to be flexible - whatever may be needed in the future.

## Set it on a solid ground

This flexibility is based on architecture that decouples frontend and backend as well as organizing functions around capabilities, which enforces a modular structure.

Furthermore, we make use of the latest tech stack by changing towards a Java and JavaScript ecosystem and providing operational abstraction by Docker and Kubernetes.
Working with open source frameworks rounds everything off, as it allows us to “stand on the shoulders of giants”.

### Based on microservices

Technically we chose microservices, which give us the advantages of

- single deployable units
- which owns its data
- communicate via REST-API or asynchronous messaging
- Exclusively responsible for its services and entities
- Provides a REST-API to leverage access to its functions
- (Freedom) of choice for micro architecture and language

### Results

As a result we have an SaaS ecommerce platform based on microservices and divided by typical ecom-domains like products, orders, customers …

And the team organisation is aligned to that structure in the meaning of one teams owns n-services (1:n) which allow decentral

- Drive innovation
- Avoid dependency and complexity
- gives high flexibility
- allows easy to replacement of services, which are "small in size"

### Additional target groups

The API-first-approach not only gives us the back the "freedom to develop" and have fun, but allows us to open up other target groups by connecting to other "systems", e.g. integrations

- Blog/CMS
- ERP
- ... (siehe Cockpit-Chart)

Nearly everyone, who enriches us or vice versa and can connect via API

Furthermore we give freelancers, agencies, partners the ability to concentrate on their customer contact and sell apropiate services, while getting all ecommerce functionalities by our SaaS-Ecommerce-Platform (Beyond), ... see belows infographic
