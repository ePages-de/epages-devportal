Nowadays almost every company is complaining about the fact that it is hard to find good employees, especially in IT. But where can they be found? Let's start directly at the beginning. When do people choose their profession? In our experience with our children we suppose that we should raise the interest in science and technology as early as possible. And as luck would have it my colleague Andreas and I from **ePages Application Management** had the chance to offer a **"Programming and robotics"** workshop at **"Heinrich-Heine-Grundschule"**, an elementary school next to our office in Jena that two of our children go to.

The workshop took place from 12th to 15th of November 2018 in our ePages office. It was part of the school project week called "Versuch's doch mal" ("Give it a try"). From Monday to Wednesday a group of students from first to fourth grade visited us for two hours each.

## Send in the Robots

As you may have already realized, robots would be very helpful for such a workshop. I made good experiences with this one which I gave my son as a gift years ago:

We decided to order four of them. So we could divide the group of students into four small ones with three or four children per group. 

**What are the robots able to do?**

The movements they can do can be "programmed" on their backs. The possible commands are "drive forwards" or "drive backwards" (10 to 15 centimeters each) and "turn left" or "turn right".
They have one arm with an magnet attached as well as a hand with which they can hold a pen. In addition the robots have ultrasonic sensors for avoiding obstacles but this feature wasn't used for our tasks.

## Here we go!

Before the students finally can let it go we did a little introduction about programming and the characteristics of a robot. The page [https://studio.code.org/projects/frozen/] was very helpful to explain the principles of programming in a very nice and child-friendly manner. After that each group of children worked at their table corner on the following tasks:

1. The first one was to pick up a remote paper clip with the magnet attached to the arm of the robot. The difficulty was to pinpoint the exact location of the paperclip. Since each robot drove slightly differently, it was not as easy as it sounds.

2. After all groups reached this goal we added different obstacles (e.g. small yogurt cups) to the route. The new goal was made out of a combination of picking up clips, avoiding the obstacles and reaching the finish line. 

3. Then we put flipchart paper on the table and the children could let their robots drawing different "pictures".

At the end of the workshop the children were allowed to make a small race with this robot: 
https://store.makeblock.com/starter-robot-kit It's controlled by an app and was brought from Andreas' home.

On Thursday we held a little presentation of the workshops and the robots at school for the the students who missed it, teachers and interested parents.
Many of the parents were surprised by the simplicity and asked for an app control. But it was this simplicity which made it easy for the children to follow the instructions and getting fast success.

## What remains?

The robots were donated to the school. The students still enthuse about this workshop. They worked concentrated, learned a lot and had much fun. We don't know if they will work in the STEM industries when they are grown up, but definitely Santa Claus has to bring a lot of robots to Jena this year :)

Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year
