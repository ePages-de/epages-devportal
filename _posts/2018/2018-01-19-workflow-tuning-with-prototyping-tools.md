The requirement for a screen design is higher than ever, as the screen design is an important component in the workflow.
No wonder, that a static design sometimes is not enough to show the whole concept and also for the use of single UI elements. As an UX/UI designer you someday will come to your limit: What brings a grandiose concept with an amazing design, if your dear colleague, the developer, does not understand how he should finally implements your creative brain output? 
That leads us to a challenge in our teams: Working together in a group of two UX designer, three UI designer and with a huge number of developers to create our great product needs a good workflow to make hand overs easier.

But help is on the way… Let’s talk about prototyping tools.

## Our 3 favorite prototyping tools in action

A prototyping tool is a software which helps you building a functional click dummy instead of a simple and static design. You can click around, fill input fields, animate toggle elements, build user flows for mobile or desktop device — depending which prototyping tool you use and which visual design software you need to combine with.  A prototype would be also able to create the perfect workflow between a concepter, a designer and a developer. 

But be careful: a prototyping tool can probably change your working life forever… ;-)

## InVision

To be honest: I only tried out the limited version, but just let me say something at the very beginning: Prototyping at InVision is fun! 

I guess it is the perfect tool for people who want to see results as soon as possible: Just after a few minutes you already know how the tool and its functions are supposed to work. 
Let’s assume you are a greenhorn and just want to have a simple website click dummy: It might take you about 15 minutes to export your final screen design, upload it to InVision and link your pages to each other with smooth crossings. You will be amazed at the result! 
But the thing is: that’s almost it… There are just a few functions and animations and sooner or later you sadly will get to your limit.    

Let's summed up the pros and cons: 

__Pros:__
-	Easy to use (e.g.: navigation from page to page, implementation of buttons) 
-	Easy & self-explanatory interface
-	Free license for a limited version for one own project
-	Easy upload of designs (GIF, PNG, JPG)
-	Real-time file sync of Sketch, Photoshop & Illustrator
-	Feedback/communication tools

__Cons:__
-	No code exports, just ZIP & PDF
-	Limited functions & animations
-	No responsive design features

## Proto.io

I saw my emotions fluctuate between effusive euphoria and angry freaking out. Never before a program or a tool affected my emotions like that!

To prototype in Proto.io feels a bit like playing god. 
From a big palette of functions for animating the behavior of a whole page to the animation of just single UI elements and working with variables – you can do nearly everything. On the other hand, it has taken so much time to understand all these powerful functions. Just designing simple UI elements of your own will take you some time at the beginning in Proto.io.
But you will see: after this exhausting time, you feel in love with your really good-looking, finished prototype, which gives you an authentic feeling of a real, already implemented website/app. 

Let's summed up the pros and cons: 

__Pros:__
-	Comes with big library of UI elements for different devices
-	Powerful tool relating to animations, functions & interactions
-	Easy to go from page to page
-	Import of Sketch & Photoshop files with a plugin 
-	Project export into PDF, PNG & HTML
-	Authentic prototype (feels like a real website/app)
 
__Cons:__
-	Takes much time to get familiar with the functions
-	Uncomfortable to create own UI elements (e.g.: jumping elements after copy & past)
-	Only design synchronization possibility: Dropbox
-	Missing responsive behavior by switching the orientation of the prototypes
-	Less tutorials

## Adobe Experience Design CC (beta)

When you first open up Adobe XD, you might be wondering how such a clean and nearly empty interface should provide you with everything you need for creating and prototyping a website/app. But don’t you underestimate this program! 

Adobe XD comes with just the most necessary tools for building a design, but with some cool features to build a good-looking click dummy. What I like most is, that you can drag design elements from other Adobe programs like Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign and also from the creative cloud library and drop them easily into your XD project. The working areas with all its functions are also well arranged and it is fun to build a prototype in here. 
But there are too less functions by now: When you build a prototype, it feels almost like faking an animation by clicking and jumping from page to page. 
There's still plenty of room for improvements, but Adobe is bringing an update for XD almost every month. Nice!

Let's summed up the pros and cons: 

__Pros:__
-	Included in Adobe Creative Cloud (compatibility with design elements of e.g.: Photoshop, Illustrator & InDesign,  access to the cloud library)
-	Offers UI kits
-	Clean interface
-	Simple but nice design tools
-	Prototype project can be shown instantly on mobile device via an add on
-	(Periodic updates of new functions)

__Cons:__
-	Still Beta
-	No code exports, just PNG, SVG, JPG & PDF
-	Limited tools for creating compact designs
-	Limited functions & animations
-	No responsive design features

## Conclusion

The thing is: there is not the perfect tool to work with in our team right now, but we decided to work with proto.io to test it at some features we want to implement in the next months.  Right now, Proto.io wins because of its dimension of functions and animations, but we still have to discover a lot.

__But now it is on you to choose the best prototyping tool for your project… :-)__
