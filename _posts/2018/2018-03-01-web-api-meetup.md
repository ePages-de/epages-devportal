On Tuesday, ePages had the pleasure to host the first [WebAPI meetup](https://www.meetup.com/de-DE/webapi-hamburg) in Hamburg in 2018.
Having recently made some good progress with our API, we took this chance and presented our way to to create an API using Spring REST Docs and RAML.
As this was my first meetup ever, I was already pretty excited how everything will be.
Let me share my impressions with you (to be honest: it's from a Technical Writing perspective but I will provide you with as much technical content and links as possible ðŸ˜‰).

## The project

As our backend developer Mathias already explained in his previous [blog post](https://developer.epages.com/blog/api-experience/restful-api-documentation-with-spring-rest-docs-and-raml/), we started using Spring REST Docs for our documentation.
As this tool is strongly connected to our tests, we could always be sure, that our documentation is up-to-date.
This way, we didn't have to worry about undocumented new fields or features.
What makes Spring REST Docs even more better: You can easily create an HTML-based documentation, such as our current [public API](http://docs.beyondshop.cloud/).
Birgit (our Technical Writer) and Mathias started their talk with this Spring Rest Docs approach and demonstrated the advantages of it.

## The journey is the reward
The way towards this status has been showcased with a short dialog between Mathias and Birgit, demonstrating the wishes of Technical Writers and the ideas our developers came up with.
They "discussed" about how to separate editorial content from the code, and how to implement a notification system to keep the Technical Writer (and thus the documentation) always up-to-date.
That means no busy Technical Writer who always tries to keep up with the changes.
Hooray!
Last but not least they tackled the "realistic example response" issue.
As our Technical Writer didn't want to include some Luke Skywalkers next to Obi-Wan Kenobis as customers in the example responses, we needed to come up with a way to create consistent and realistic test data. The solution: A test data catalog.

## Future plans

Currently, having this kind of a static documentation live is great, but we would like to come up with an interactive documentation in the nearer future.
For this approach, [RAML](https://raml.org/) seems to be a great choice from developer perspective.
The main reason for choosing RAML is, that we can keep the benefits of Spring REST docs by building [restdocs-raml](https://github.com/ePages-de/restdocs-raml).
So, in combination with some other open source projects, RAML offers great possibilities to build an interactive documentation.
If you are more interested in this part, check the [presentation slides](https://mduesterhoeft.github.io/spring-restdocs-raml-talk) or the [sample project](https://github.com/mduesterhoeft/spring-restdocs-raml-talk) and get some more ideas of what is planned.

## My overall impression

Next to all these interesting information, both, from developer and from technical writing perspective, what else came up to my mind when joining this meetup?
In my opinion, the meetup has been a great chance to present our approach, get some feedback and have a chat about it over some delicious snacks and drinks.
I've noticed, that the attendees that made it through the current wave of flu and the snowy weather have been quite interested and that getting some feedback always helps to improve and realize different mindsets.
So, I've definitely become a meetup fan and look forward to my next one ðŸ™‚!
