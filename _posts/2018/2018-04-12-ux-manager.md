Phew.
I didn't.
But I was curious and met for a coffee with our UX Managers here at ePages.
What is it that makes UX such a buzzword these days?
And where did they get their superpower?

## Where it all begins

Obviously, their background is not business administration or biology ðŸ˜‰.

Our Usability Expert Anja holds a Master in Media and Communication Science.
This course of studies has many interfaces with UX, e.g. psychology or design, but also sets great focus on user research.
It also covered a broad spectrum of human-machine interaction topics, and combines content from the fields of economic sciences and law.

Also for Lena, our UX Manager, interdisciplinary orientation was key in her studies.
She has a Master in Information Science.
The content of her study courses is also very varied: linguistics, communication, online marketing, human-machine interaction, computer science...
Being a bit worried about what to do with all these different areas, the professors always reassured them "Don't worry. You will be the perfect interface!"

## Interfaces! More interfaces!

They got me interested.



## There is nothing like usability


That's what Anja and Lena unanimously answered when I asked them what UX means to them.


## Let's talk facts
