## Hamburg at the EuRuKo

This story started 8 months ago, at the [European Ruby Conference](/blog/events/epages-at-euruko-is-ruby-still-alive/) in Budapest. For choosing the next city where the conference is going to take place, people have to propose a city. Two guys from Hamburg proposed Hamburg and they got an awesome second place.

After seen the amount of people that wanted a conference in Hamburg, the co-founder of the Hamburg Ruby User Group with the support of other people organised this awesome Ruby Unconf.

## Fun fact

People from our company where surprised when I joined ePages and we became two Unais working on the same team. It was a name that they didn't heard before.

But was even more surprising for our CTO when we found a third Unai at the Ruby Unconf. Here is the proof:
