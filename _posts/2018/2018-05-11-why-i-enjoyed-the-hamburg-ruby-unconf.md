## Hamburg at the EuRuKo

This story started 8 months ago, at the [European Ruby Conference](/blog/events/epages-at-euruko-is-ruby-still-alive/) in Budapest. For choosing the next city where the conference is going to take place, people have to propose a city. Two guys proposed Hamburg and they got an awesome second place.

After seen the amount of people that wanted a conference in Hamburg, the co-founder of the [Hamburg Ruby User Group](http://hamburg.onruby.de/){:target="_blank"} with the support of other people organised this [Ruby Unconf](https://rubyunconf.eu/){:target="_blank"}.

## What is an Unconference?

This is some information for those that don't know what an unconference is.

The principal of an unconference is that the agenda is created by the attendees at the beginning of the meeting. Some persons present the topics they want to talk about and after that everyone votes the wanted ones. Then the daily agenda is organised.

## The Hamburg Ruby Unconf

When we arrived we went to the registration place. We got our identification card as well as some presents (like a bamboo coffee cup) and stickers, lots of stickers! Is there any developer that doesn't like stickers?

Then the two conference days had more or less the same schedule: present the topics, vote and join the different talks. We were joining some super interesting talks like:

- Background Jobs at Scale by Kerstin Puschke
- The (even longer) Road from Capistrano to Kubernetes by Tobias Schwab
- Ruby is Full of Suprises by Jan Lelis
- Property Testing by Ana Maria Martinez Gomez
- Preconnect, prefetch, preload, pre-what? How to speed up websites with Resource hints by Robin Drexler
- A MP3 player for very small, small and big kids by Christoph
- It looks like ruby, but it doesn't Quack! by Ole Michaelis
- UX Sketching 101 by Fabian
- The Crystal Language from ~scratch~ ruby by S√©rgio Gil

We also had catering during the lunch time so we didn't have to find any restaurant near by and, trust me, the food was delicious.

## Party time!

Yes, we are developers but we also like party üéâ.

After the first conference day finished the event continued on Reeperbahn, at the Bidges & Sons bar. There we meet a lot of people from different parts of Germany and Spain. We where having interesting talks with them while having some cocktails.

## The funny moment

People from our company where surprised when I joined ePages and we became two Unais working on the same team. They didn't heard that name before.

But was even more surprising for our CTO when we found a third Unai at the Hamburg Ruby Unconf:

## Special mention

I would like to give a big thank to all the people that was involved organising this conference because, in the end, you made it possible, and also to the presenters. All the talks that we joined were super interesting and we learned a bit from all of them.

So, yes. This is the reason why I'm going to join the Hamburg Ruby Unconf next year again üòÅ.
