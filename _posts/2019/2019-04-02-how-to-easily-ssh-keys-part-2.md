## Implementing the backend

In the last part we created our information storage. Now its time to implement the backend.

You may read my other blogposts and recognized that im a big fan of [Golang](https://golang.org/){:target="_blank"} and both the API and frontend is written in it.
Also i've written and maintain a [client library impementation](https://github.com/cseeger-epages/i-doit-go-api){:target="_blank"} for i-doit in golang.

For writting REST APIs in golang there are quite some good tutorials on the internet and there are also some good frameworks.
But i've written my own from scratch which you can find [here](https://github.com/cseeger-epages/restfool-go){:target="_blank"}.
There are also some simple examples for implementing handler and path routing stuff in the [examples section](https://github.com/cseeger-epages/restfool-go/tree/master/examples){:target="_blank"}.

So we can concentrate on the CMDB specific parts.
Also the nessesary information should be provided by the user using HTTP POST as data payload.

To not mess with authentication we use the authentication of the i-doit API and just pass username and password through (or create a token).
We now need to get the user id and the following simple trick helps us here:

```
  a, err := goidoit.NewLogin(URL, APIKEY, USERNAME, PASSWORD)
  if err != nil {
    // put your error handling here
  }

  data, _ := a.Version()
  // the version contains also user information we can use
  id, err := strconv.Atoi(data.Result[0]["login"].(map[string]interface{})["userid"].(string))
  if err != nil {
    // put your error handling here
  }
```
To store our ssh keys we can use the following struct

```
// SSHKey contains ssh key information
type SSHKey struct {
  ID      int    `json:"id"`
  Key     string `json:"key"`
  Label   string `json:"label"`
  Primary string `json:"primary"`
  Date    string `json:"date"`
}
```
and get the ssh-keys for the user

```

  keyData, err := a.GetCat(id, "C__CATG__CUSTOM_FIELDS_SSHKEYS")
  if err != nil {
    // put your error handling here
  }

```
That was easy but now comes the tricky part you need the custom field specific index.
You will find it in the configuration page where you created the custom category under **show technical configuration**.
The indexes here are just examples so don't try to use them.
Now just loop over the result and map them to fit the struct.

```
  var sshKeys []SSHKey

  if keyData.Result != nil {
    for _, v := range keyData.Result {

      var key, date, label, primary string

      if v["f_text_c_1506425983066"] != nil {
        key = v["f_text_c_1506425983066"].(string)
      }
      if v["f_text_c_1508155981380"] != nil {
        date = v["f_text_c_1508155981380"].(string)
      }
      if v["f_text_c_1510835561457"] != nil {
        label = v["f_text_c_1510835561457"].(string)
      }
      if v["f_dialog_c_1510835574647"].(map[string]interface{})["title"] != nil {
        primary = v["f_dialog_c_1510835574647"].(map[string]interface{})["title"].(string)
      }

      id, err := strconv.Atoi(v["id"].(string))
      if err != nil {
        // put your error handling here
      }
      sshKeys = append(sshKeys, SSHKey{id, key, label, primary, date})
    }
  }
```
Dont be confused by lines like this

```
  v["f_dialog_c_1510835574647"].(map[string]interface{})["title"].(string)
```
the `.(map[string]interface{})` is a concept in go called [type assertions](https://tour.golang.org/methods/15){:target="_blank"} that just assigns a specific type to an interface.
In our case we assign `map[string]interface{}` to it which is similar to an associative array where the key is a string and the value itself is also just `interface{}`.
Then the index `title` is called and the `string` type is assigned to the interface.
I say similar to arrays because go does not often make use of arrays, it has [slices](https://www.godesignpatterns.com/2014/05/arrays-vs-slices.html){:target="_blank"}.

If you want to add a key to a user you can do this more or less the same way:
```
  keyData := struct {
    SSHKey  string `json:"f_text_c_1506425983066"`
    Date    string `json:"f_text_c_1508155981380"`
    Label   string `json:"f_text_c_1510835561457"`
    Primray string `json:"f_dialog_c_1510835574647"`
    Desc    string `json:"description"`
  }{key, date, label, primary, ""}

  _, err = a.CreateCat(id, "C__CATG__CUSTOM_FIELDS_SSHKEYS", keyData)
  if err != nil {
    // put your error handling here
  }
```
this adds a new ssh-key.

We now know everyting to implement specific filters and combinations e.g:

- selecting a group from our cmdb and getting all members and then getting all ssh-keys (and maybe filter them)
- we could easly just add people to existing querys that already contain one or more groups
- of course filtering the label, date, primary whatever is no problem

Also our beloved friend `curl` the comandline data transfer tool can be used against our API.

An example could look like this:

```
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Basic $(echo 'user:password' | base64)" \
 -d "[]group=some Team" \
 -d "[]group=some other Team" \
 -d "[]add=some additional user" \
 -d "[]label=mylabel1" \
 -d "[]label=mylabel2" \
 -d "raw=true" \
 https://ssh-api-url/key/export | jq -r '.["authorized_keys"]'
```

The `[]group` array is used to add groups to our query `[]add` to simply add person and `[]label` lets us filter for specific labels.
I added the `raw` attribute to be able to get the keys as a data block instead of getting every key via a seperate JSON structure.

which is just a difference between:
```
// AuthKeysResponseRaw for raw authorized_keys
type AuthKeysResponseRaw struct {
  AuthorizedKeys string `json:"authorized_keys"`
}
```

and 

```
// AuthKeysResponse for authorized_keys list
type AuthKeysResponse struct {
  AuthorizedKeys []SSHKey `json:"authorized_keys"`
}

```
Since everything is return as JSON we can use a cli tool called `jq` to parse the whole stuff.

Using `curl` it is easy to implement a bash script wrapper to simplify the commandline usage.

From here on we should have a working API as a good foundation to create a frontend.

I leave it to the reader to implement the API into a fully grown frontend service.
But to give you some hints how this could look like here is a picture of what i did.
