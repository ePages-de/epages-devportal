Hi, my name is Kathia. 
I come from Bolivia and I'm working as a Software Developer at ePages since March 2019.
I applied online in late 2018.
First, I had an interview with Serena, the HR Recruiter.
After the interview, I had to solve a coding challenge.
The next week, I had an interview with Unai, one of the developers of my current team, to discuss about a few things about my code and previous experience.
In the next days, I had an interview with Harms, the CTO, and Serena.
Finally, I received the offer from ePages 10 days before Christmas.
So, this was like a gift in advance for me :)

## Why the decision was easy

I learnt German in Bolivia and reached a pretty decent level - B1 ;) 
In 2018, I had the chance to take a one-month course in DÃ¼sseldorf and then I spent one more month in Aachen.
Overall this first experience strengthened my desire of living and working in Germany.
Of course leaving friends and family is not easy. 
Even worse, if you have an adorable dog that has been with you in the last 15 years :( but life is about challenges, so I didn't hesitate to take this opportunity to live and work in Hamburg, which is one of the most beautiful cities.

## Getting the Visa

Since I come from a non-EU country, I had to apply for a visa to get a EU Blue Card, which is a work- and residence permit that I didn't know about until the company told me that I could apply to it.
Getting the paperwork done for the visa was easier than I expected. During this process, I got support from Serena and Elisa, the HR Manager. My visa was approved one week after the interview at the German Embassy.

## The company

I had a nice welcome on my first day at work.
That week, we had the ePages Hackathon.
Thanks to this event, it was possible to meet the colleagues from Jena and Barcelona. 
During the first weeks, there were a couple of meetings organized by one member of the different teams to give the new employees and I, an overview about the role of the team at ePages, so we can know what everyone does, what technologies they use and what projects they are working on. 

## My team

I'm part of the Team 42, along with Unai and German, the developers from Spain. 
We mainly work with Ruby, Ruby on Rails and also JavaScript.
We have the daily meetings at 09:15 with Timo, the Product Owner, and Elisa (another Elisa!), the SCRUM Master.

## Getting the Blue Card

Parallel to work, I had to take care of some German documents needed, such as the address registration, bank account and health insurance.
All that went fine.
Once I got everything ready, I requested the Blue Card at the immigration office. 
The only thing I can complain about is that I had to go very early... at 7 a.m!
