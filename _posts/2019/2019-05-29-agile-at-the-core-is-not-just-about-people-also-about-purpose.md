Already in the introduction of the ACE! conference of Krakow you could tell that the conference is delivering what they promise: Being agile in the sense of focusing on the “user” (so we attendees) needs: Nearly half of the program should be created and shaped by us via open space topics (as the organizer claimed, he is often wrong when he assumes what people want or even more complex what people need).
There was an expert corner at which you could have had a one-o-one talk with some of the speaker of the conference.
We had a creative space, a quite space and of course the feedback corner could not have been missed at an agile conference!

But enough about the set-up.
They also had really nice and interesting talks, from which I want to share my highlights with you.
Not just due to the fact that I am really bad in summarizing and come to the most important point of a topic, I will just not even try and do it my way: I will share my most favorite quote out of the talk and just associate what it was about and what I’ve learned from it – maybe that also will trigger some thoughts of yours ;)

### "Relationship status: My wife asked me what I wanted for dinner and then told me I was wrong."

This beautiful quote actually comes from a tweet the speaker of the talk "creating cultures of empathy" quoted herself.
It highlights the fact that what always is left for us as listener is our opinion of what the other said and not the actual points.
To have that in mind you should try to rephrase the things you got out of the listening and observing the other one.
What I also took out of the keynote: Empathy as a noun is an idea, as an action it is a choice.

### "Everyone can be a team player in the fitting context."

That was said during the talk “build a product based on values” and was to stress out, that our values also need to fit to our skills.
If we have certain values, that doesn't fit to us as persons, it won’t bring us far.
But if our values are actually matching our competencies, this is what will get us further.
That's also why it doesn't help if values are forced down from the top, either you choose the employees also based on the company values or you extract the values out of the stock of your stuff (e.g. via a poll you can find out which values your employees share and define the coorperated values of the company.

### "Pair programming with a stranger is like navigating through a city with someone you don’t know, is probably an axe murderer and speaks a different language than you – and you still need to be nice."

Wow, what an analogy!
This speaker did know how to get his attention.
Although at some moments I think his opinion were a bit extreme or at least I had the impression, that he painted the world just in black and white.
I took some really interesting points out of his talk "10 years of being a tracer bullet through a phenomenon", what was a summery about the development of agile.
Learnings for me:

* We need a stable and healthy team, that can trust itself (see quote)
* Different kinds of leadership are needed based on context (“We suck in getting the patterns of context”)
* For agile all the parties need to change ("It's incompetent leadership if you don’t recognize that the change you bring in also will (have to) change you.")
* Don't pretend that you have the power to change something if you don't 
* Agile at the core is not just about people also about purpose!

You can see by now how many interesting talks and people have been at the conference.
Also pretty amazing was the talk "using neuroscience to build high performance teams" – it is all about certainty, status, autonomy, relatedness, fairness & success.
In the presentation about "MVP rediscovered" I got reminded how important it is to have your assumption clear for yourself, tested and proofed before you take further steps.
In my open space sessions we philosophized if we really believe in agile or lean, we talked about how to adapt to the spotify-model and how we can stop the "empathy-insanity and build cool shit" (conclusion: just with a certain level of empathy you are able to build useful, cool shit).
I had a great time and not just received a lot of information, through the set-up I could contribute myself and was able to got some really nice learnings from that!
