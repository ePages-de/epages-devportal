Already in the introduction of the [ACE! conference](https://aceconf.com/#!/home){:target="_blank"} in Krakow one could see that the conference would fulfil what had been promised: being agile in the sense of focusing on the "user" (us attendees) needs.
Nearly half of the program was to be created and shaped by us via open space topics (as the organizer claimed, he is often wrong when he assumes what people want, or even more complex, what people need).
There was an expert corner where you could have had a one-to-one talk with some of the speakers of the conference.
We had a creative space, a quiet space, and of course the feedback corner was a must at an agile conference!

But enough about the setup.
The conference offered really nice and interesting talks, from which I want to share my highlights with you.
Not just due to the fact that I am really bad at summarizing and coming to the most important point of a topic, I will just not even try and do it my way: I will share my most favorite quote from the talk, and just associate what it was about, and what I've learned from it.
Maybe that will also trigger some thoughts of yours 😉.

### "Relationship status: My wife asked me what I wanted for dinner, and then told me I was wrong."

This beautiful quote actually comes from a tweet that the speaker of the talk "Creating cultures of empathy" quoted herself.
It highlights the fact that what always is left for us as listeners is our opinion of what the other said, and not the actual points.
To have that in mind you should try to rephrase the things you got out of the listening and observing the other one.
What I also took out of the keynote: empathy as a noun is an idea, as an action it is a choice.

### "Everyone can be a team player in the fitting context."

That was said during the talk “Build a product based on values” and was to emphasize that our values also need to fit to our skills.
If we have certain values, that don't fit to us as persons, it won't bring us far.
But if our values are actually matching our competencies, this is what will get us further.
That's also why it doesn't help if values are forced down from the top, either you choose the employees also based on the company values, or you extract the values out of the stock of your stuff (e.g. via a poll you can find out which values your employees share and define the coorperated values of the company).

### "Pair programming with a stranger is like navigating through a city with someone you don’t know; it's probably an axe murderer and speaks a different language than you – and you still need to be nice."

Wow, what an analogy!
This speaker did know how to get the attention.
Although at some points I think his opinion was a bit extreme or at least I had the impression, that he painted the world just in black and white.
I took some really interesting points out of his talk "10 years of being a tracer bullet through a phenomenon". 
It was a summary about the development of agile.
My learnings:

* We need a stable and healthy team, that can trust itself (see quote).
* Different kinds of leadership are needed based on context ("we suck in getting the patterns of context").
* For agile all parties need to change ("It's incompetent leadership if you don't recognize that the change you bring in also will (have to) change you.").
* Don't pretend that you have the power to change something if you don't.
* Agile at the core is not just about people also about purpose!

You can see by now how many interesting talks and people have been at the conference.
Also pretty amazing was the talk "Using neuroscience to build high performance teams" – it is all about certainty, status, autonomy, relatedness, fairness, and success.
In the presentation about "MVP rediscovered" I got reminded how important it is to have your assumption clear for yourself, tested, and proofed before you take further steps.
In my open space sessions we philosophized if we really believe in agile or lean, we talked about how to adapt to the Spotify-model, and how we can stop the "empathy-insanity and build cool shit" (conclusion: just with a certain level of empathy you are able to build useful, cool shit 😃).

I had a great time and not just received a lot of information.
With this conference format I could contribute myself, and was able to get some really nice learnings from that!
