When I first heard about a software localization conference in Hamburg, I was thrilled.
Such a big city should definitely have that topic on the screen!
And a conference is the best place to share opinions and experiences about that.

As this was the first time the conference was held, I had no clue what it will look like.
So, last Thursday my colleague and I headed out to the [Hello World conference](https://lp.phraseapp.com/lp/hello-world/){:target="_blank"} - full of hope and dreams ðŸ˜‰
And that's how it was:

## The WOW moment

I know that the venue shouldn't be the most important part of a conference, and it wasn't!
But it has been the first thing that we saw when leaving the elavator.
And it was stunning!
20th floor right next to the harbour.
Do I need to say more?
It definitely was a great start into the day!

## The academic background

After we enjoyed the view, the conference started of with talks related to machine translation and machine learning.
The speakers mostly had an academic background and worked at universities.
That's not bad at all but their talks were a bit too theoretical for my colleague and me.
But it was definitely worth listening to for everyone who is into neural vs statistical machine translation, and the latest researches and findings regarding that topic.

My favorite takeaway was that one way to answer the question "What makes a translation useful" is another question: "How well is who did what to whom, for whom, when, where, why and how preserved in translation". ([Meriem Beloucif](https://twitter.com/meriembeloucif){:target="_blank"})

## It's all about processes and experiences

Afterwards, the talks were shifted from a more theorical view to a more practical one.
Anne Sophie Delafosse kicked this part of with a talk about the challenges of localization at [Deliveroo](https://twitter.com/Deliveroo){:target="_blank"}.
When listening to it, I once again knew why I wanted to participate in that conference!
As Deliveroo is also working with the software localization tool [PhraseApp](https://phraseapp.com/){:target="_blank"}, they've made similar or even the same experiences in terms of localization as we did.
It was great to see how they tackled their challenges and which workarounds and processes they use in [comparison to us](/blog/language-and-localization/rocking-the-stage-with-a-software-localization-tool/).

The next speakers were a bit concerned that they'll only repeat what Anne Sophie just presented in her talk as they were also presenting their localization history and related workflows.
But there was no reason for that.
Each and every company found a flow that fits best to their needs and possibilities and it was interesting to get to know about them.

One lesson that they all had in common: Localization is a vital part of a product.
People will not use it if they do not understand it.
That's why it's not enough to "simply" translate words and sentences.
You need to have so much more in mind: Do you need to adapt images, colors, even whole workflows?

A good example for different workflows was brought up by [Rikard Eide](https://twitter.com/rix1){:target="_blank"} who works at [Otovo](https://twitter.com/OtovoSolar){:target="_blank"}, a company offering a solar platform.
When they were thinking about expanding from Norway to Sweden, they figured out that translating their software is not enough.
They needed a whole new step as they were missing some information that they were automatically provided with for customers living in Norway.

## Not every native speaker can translate your software

Another lesson that nearly all speakers had in common when talking about their localization history: You need professional translators.
This should be somehow obvious to everyone involved in software localization.
But the reality shows that it's often easier, faster, and cheaper to ask a colleague via Slack or Mattermost.
As they work with the product on a daily basis and speak the required language, they will surely be able to help you out.
But as Antonella Zagaria summarized nicely: "Native speaker != translator".

## It was all about the HOW

As you may have noticed, nothing of the above was really totally new to people working in the field of software localization.
But that's not the point.
There are plenty of articles about localization requirements and localization guidelines out there.
But what's missing in most of them are the failures and challenges on the way towards the final results.
The little details about how people actually worked them out, or tips and tricks for workarounds when already working with a software localization tool.

Of course, also some general topics were covered, but this conference was clearly more about the HOW than the WHY or WHAT in terms of localizing software.
And that's why I gained so much from it!
