## Dear diary, today I created a fabric shop.

I have started my internship at ePages in Hamburg.
I decided to change my University life to with the experience to work like an Ux-er.
When I started here last month, I got a very warm welcome and I soon felt like a part of the company.
Instead of just copying stuff and boiling coffee, I could already do a lot of different tasks by my own.
Also, I was a part of the meetings from my first day on.

### My little diary

One of the first tasks that I did was a Diary Study.
According to the Nielsen-Norman group it is a qualitative usability research method that can give insights about user behaviors and needs.
In this case, I slipped into the role of a merchant who sets up an online shop for the first time.
I noted down what I did in the first 10 minutes and also every little issue that I came across: Not knowing how to do something, everything that doesn't work like I would expect it, an unexpected step in the workflow, a function to do something that I miss.... 

### Welcome to my shop!

I set up my own online shop for fabrics: since I am very passionate about sewing I created a shop to sell fabrics, "lucky bags" (little scraps of fabric) and some accessories like scissors.

It was fun to create all my products and to think of how to present my shop in a nice way.
I could also see how my storefront would look like later an and I did a test purchase to see how everything works.
I even invented marketing strategies like coupons and call-to-action buttons to present new products and link them to their product page.

### Is my work actually saved?

One issue that I noticed concerns the saving process.
While editing my pages in the editor I didn't get any indication whether my work is saved automatically or if I should save it by my own.
Only after talking about this issue later on I discovered that actually there already exits a confirmation message to indicate that the changes are saved.
It is just bit hidden in the left corner:

## All done- and now?

After completing the task I turned my diary into a list of UX-issues and presented it to the ProductManagement.
They were curious about what can be improved and since I brought a new perspective on our product it helped to discover several issues.
Since it was the first time for me to create an online shop I could tell the PM if the descriptions and help centre articles are helpful.
I also advised them where a tooltip or another description might simplify the setting up.
For me, it was the perfect task to actually get to know our software and also to get an intuition for UX-issues.
So now, whenever my colleagues are in a discussion about our Software I know what they are talking about and often I can give input from my experience as a user.  
Also, as a next task I will examine the onboarding process of the merchant and check what can be improved.
My study is the ideal basis because I already know some issues and I can rely on my experience.
And the best: I know how a merchant might feel when creating an online shop with our software which is a crucial part of working on the User Experience of the epages Shopsoftware.

### Conclusion

To conclude this was the perfect task for me. I learned a lot about our product and the perspective of a merchant.
It was a lot of fun to set up everything and to create my own shop.
Also, I helped ePages to discover some UX-issues.
