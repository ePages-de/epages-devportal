While our development teams are crafting a [new ecommerce product](https://signup.beyondshop.cloud/epages){:target="_blank"} for our customers, we as technical writers do everything we can, to best teach online merchants how to use this product.
By publishing easy to understand articles and providing support in our [help center](https://online-help.zendesk.com/hc/en-us){:target="_blank"}, we empower them to become successful with their online business.
In this post, I tell you how we do that.
