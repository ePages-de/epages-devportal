Summer is coming to an end, sun is shining, you would like to be outside to enjoy the last sunrays of late sommer, but your are sitting in your conference room moderating the retrospective…
Wait, wasn’t one of the goals to have non-repetitive retrospectives? 
Why not bring your retrospective outside? 

Here a 3 tips on how to do it:

1.	Walk and talk Retrospective
2.	Outdoor Retrospective
3.	Combine out- and indoor Restrospective

## Walk and talk

Doing your retrospective outside while going for a walk is a nice way for the team to have a little break from your usual office setup.
Walking and the fresh air keep the brain going. 
My teams often gave the feedback that it helped them to speak about difficult topics while walking.
Here is how we do it:

1.	Start in the team space: Throw a ball and ask everyone how he or she feels today
2.	Give guiding questions: I have small print outs prepared for everyone, explain the route we go and agree on where and when we meet for Wrap up
3.	Wrap up with the whole team checking what everyone learned. This can be outside using a ball to throw around

Some more things to keep in mind: 
Agree on a common start and endpoint, and make sure they know where it is, so no one gets lost.
If possible try not to walk on the side of noisy roads because this could hinder conversation
Split up in teams of 2-3, so that people can hear each other. 
You might switch groups after half of the time has passed.
Make sure you have a closing round with everyone and ask- either “What have you learned today” or “What do you take out of this retrospective” or “What action item will you take with you”.
So that you and the teams get an idea about what the other teams have talked about.
I usually take notes when doing the final round and add those sentences or action items to the retro documentation.

Extra tip: If you want to get action items out of the walk and talk, you might as well ask: “What bothered you most during last iteration?” and “What can you do about it to improve the situation? Find at least one actionable task!” 
Then share the action items each team member has defined in a final wrap up with everyone.

## Outdoor retrospective

If you have a nice and quiet space outside your office space you might as well do a proper retrospective outdoors. 
It is important that the place is really quiet (no street noise, street works, etc) and also sheltered from wind. When the place is whindy, team members might not understand what others were saying when the wind took the voice into a different direction.
Inner courtyards are perfect for this, you could then use the walls of the buildings for hanging up flipcharts and stickies. 
If the location is close you could also take the flipchart stand outside.
Be careful with such a setting and try everything out beforehand, because it can be really annoying for the team if they can’t hear each other or if the stickies are taken away by the wind…
So far we haven’t used such a setting, because all locations are not quiet enough here in the city.

## Combine outside and indoor retrospective

If your team is not very experienced or you are worried about actionable outcomes you might as well combine indoor and outdoor retrospective:
1.	Start in a conference room with gathering stickies, group the topics and find 3-5 topics to discuss about
2.	Split the team into groups or pairs and let each pair choose a topic to discuss together and create action items
3.	Let the groups take a walk while discussing the topics for 20 minutes
4.	Meet again in the meeting room and let everyone present their topics
