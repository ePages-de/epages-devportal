As every year at this time, the ePages design team set off again to visit the design and web development conference "beyond tellerrand" in Berlin.
For the team and me this conference was very inspiring, as many interesting speakers from different areas gave very informative presentations.
The special thing about the beyond tellerrand conference is not only the array of lectures, but also the strong connection to the community and the familiar atmosphere. What is also unique is the generous breaks between the individual talks, which are designed to allow visitors social contact with others and to create space for interesting conversations and discussions.

## Day one: Where does the internet come from?
 
Arriving at the conference hall we started already.
The team and I were waiting for two days full of interesting presentations about different topics.
The beginning on Thursday was made by web developer and writer Jeremy Keith with a lecture on "The Layers of the Web" in which he talked about what the original idea of the World Wide Web looked like and how the framework of technology behind the Internet works.

Jeremy Keith's talk was followed by further lectures on topics such as:
 
* Interactive web animation with SVG (by Cassie Evans)
* Conversational Semantics (by Aaron Gustafson)
* On Finding Purpose (by Burton Rast)
* Headbuilder (by Wilfrid Wood)
* The Story of You (by Mike Hill)

All these lectures were inspiring and interesting in their own way.
One lecture dealt with the topic of barrier-free operation of a website for visually impaired people and another dealt with interactive web animations using SVG graphics.
 
But also motivating lectures like for example about the crazy, long lasting and nevertheless very successful career phase of Burton Rast were not too scarce.
After the talks of the first day had come to an end, we let the evening fade away with a meal together in the team and then fell into our beds with many positive oaths.

## Day Two: Seb Lester’s mind-blowing calligraphy
 
Also the second day of beyond tellerrand was filled with many exciting contents.
Natalya Shelburne started on Friday with a talk about how developers and designers can work together more closely in the future to achieve better results in their work and to work more productively.

* Taking The Web Off The Screen (by Charlotte Dann)
* Talking Genitals and the Oldest Women in the World (by Anna Ginsburg)
* Dynamic Typography with Variable Fonts (by Jason Pamenthal)
* Peace, Hellfire & Unicorns (by Seb Lester)
* CSS at the Intersection (by Natalya Shelburne)
* Engaging Empathy (by Sharon Steed)

Also on this day all lectures were very informative and informative.
You could take something for yourself from almost every lecture and in addition there were many positive food for thought.
But my personal favorite is and remains Seb Lester's talk.
He is a well-known type designer and talked about how he started designing fonts out of passion.
Over time, he saw his own fonts more and more in public and ended up designing for big companies like H&M, Intel, Nike, Apple, The New York Times and many more.
 
His two biggest projects were designing a logo for a NASA space mission and a font for the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver.
However, Seb Lester is not only known for his fonts, his calligraphic arts are also popular around the world.
On Instagram, over a million followers watch him inspire his art.

## Summary
 
In summary, it can be said that the visit of beyond tellerrand was worthwhile in every respect.
Even if a single talk didn't appeal to you personally, the following one was all the more exciting.
There was a balance between lectures on web development, design, art and motivating stories.
The conference provided many food for thought and opened up new ways to be more productive in the team and to work efficiently and happily overall.
Definitely this was not the last beyond tellerrand for us!
