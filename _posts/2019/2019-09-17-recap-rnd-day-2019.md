Every year during this time we organize our R&D Day.
Developers from all locations gather togehter and spend a day on topics that are currently relevant to them or might be exciting to work on.
During the last two months all colleagues had the opportunity to bring in topics they would like to learn more about or have something to share themselves.
With the help of our Scrum Masters this converted into a one-day agenda with a nice mixture of talks, workshops, and open spaces.
Spoiler alert: and of course there was no way around pizza üçï!

Our Scrum Master Stefanie started the presentation series with a great talk about "Unconcious Bias".
This was so eye-opening!
After a small intro we were split into groups to brainstorm solutions together, and discuss recommendations on what to do with a specific unconcious bias situation.
There were issues such as "A coworker asks: Who's the new girl?" or "You're in a meeting and a female colleague is spoken over or interrupted."
