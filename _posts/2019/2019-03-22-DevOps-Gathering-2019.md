From 11.03.2019 to 13.03.2019 the 3rd DevOps Gathering took place on the G Data Campus, Bochum.
With 31 Speakers and 199 Attendencies it was a very exciting and extensive conference. 
But it not only was a pure conference it also featured a nice workshop day.

 ## 11.03.2019 Workshop Day
This first day of this 3 day DevOps meetup was supposed to be all about workshops. A perfect fit for Cloud Native 
Engeneers and SRE´s. You had the chance to learn from exciting Cloud Native enablers, Docker Community members and 
international experts. The workshops also left room for experiments and talks with other attendencies. From docker 
security to Kubernetes on Amazon EKS and a Kubernetes 101 it was a kind of everything DevOps is about. 
But also an introduction to agile working took place.


 ## 12.03.2019 Talk Day 1

With Day 2 of the meetup the series of talks began. 
Starting with a talk about DevOps and experiments to a talk about Software Craftmannship held by former epagee 
Benjamin Nothdurft and his colleague Sandra Parsick about software engineering that aims to regard software 
development as a skilled craft instead of a classical engineering approach.

The Session continued with talks about Kubernetes for attendencies without any technical background this talk explained
the use of Kubernetes and how you can make the best use out of the Tool HELM for your container systems with Kubernetes.
The afternoon was filled with sessions about Docker Containers on Windows Server 2019 held by Stefan Scherer form the
Docker Inc. and last but not least the sessions ended with talks about Go as Tooling language for any Cloud 
system and some lightning Talks about Security and how you can can convince your company about DevOps is a transitional
mode of operations and the means to a goal instead of goal in itself. What comes after DevOps is ?done??
Int the evening the Conference party took place where you where able to talk to other people also joining the confernce
and share your experience with DevOps. Of course we had a something to eat and drink also.
 
 ## 13.03.2019 Final Day

The last day of talks started wit a slot about how Google started there path with DevOps. Mario Kleinsasser and 
Alexander Ortner then held a very interesting talk about how the STRABAG AG faced the change from there Monolit 
Software architecture to a dockerized system. I think this is something most companys have to deal with. Also the talk
about consumer-based contract testing from Stephan Stapel of the HERMES GmbH gave some interesting insights how HERMES
deals with testing changes on a regular bases and how they deal with changes to there contracts.
The last parts of the final Day at the DevOps Gathering 2019 was about how you can best use Kubernetes for many clusters
and how you can use it to deliver cloud native apps on Azure.
 
Visiting the DevOps Gathering is for any person with DevOps experiences or the desire to be able to use DevOps technics
a good solution. Not only you can listen to Talks from very experienced peoplle but also you can make use of the Workshop
day where you can take a deeper look into DevOps specific work.
I personally learned alot about Kubernetes and was surprised how many companys face the same differneces that we do and
get a deeper look into the work of our Application Management Team.
