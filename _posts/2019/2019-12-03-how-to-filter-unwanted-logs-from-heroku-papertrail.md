Some days ago we wanted to add [Papertrail](https://elements.heroku.com/addons/papertrail){:target="_blank"} to one of our [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/){:target="_blank"}-hosted projects and discovered a problem: _Heroku router was logging some critical information_.
In this blog post I'm going to explain you how to filter unwanted logs from the Heroku Papertrail add-on.

### The challenge

When a merchant installs an app, a `GET` request is triggered to the app's Callback URL with the information that the developer needs to identify the merchant.
This information (like the `api_url`, the `code` or the `signature`) is sent as query parameters.
The request looks like this:

```bash
GET /callback_url?code={code}&signature={signature}&return_url={return_url}&api_url={api_url}&access_token_url={access_token_url}
```

We didn't want to store that information on our logs so we thought: _"Ok, we are using Rails. Let's add some filtering to `config/initializers/filter_parameter_logging.rb`"_, so we added the following to the file:

```ruby
Rails.application.config.filter_parameters += [
  :signature,
  :return_url,
  :api_url,
  :access_token_url,
  :code]
```

It worked!
Our local development logs looked like this:

```bash
Started GET "/callback_url?access_token_url=[FILTERED]&api_url=[FILTERED]&code=[FILTERED]&return_url=[FILTERED]&signature=[FILTERED]"`
```

```bash
Parameters: {"access_token_url"=>"[FILTERED]", "api_url"=>"[FILTERED]", "code"=>"[FILTERED]", "return_url"=>"[FILTERED]", "signature"=>"[FILTERED]"}`
```

But when we pushed these changes to Heroku and installed the Papertrail add-on we discovered that, yes, Rails logs were correctly filtered, but Heroku was still logging the request with the `heroku/router` program:

```bash
heroku/router: at=info method=GET path="/callback_url?access_token_url=<real-info>&api_url=<real-info>&code=<real-info>&return_url=<real-info>&signature=<real-info>" ...
```

### The solution

In order to prevent Heroku router from filtering unwanted parameters, you can do the following:

1. In Papertrail go to **Settings > Filter logs > Add Log Filter**.
2. Select `Regex` filter type and fill out the filter with the following code: `heroku\/router:.*(signature|return_url|api_url|access_token_url|code)`
3. Activate the filter

Et voil√†!
With this configuration, logs from `heroku/router` that contain your secret parameters will be ignored and never saved.
