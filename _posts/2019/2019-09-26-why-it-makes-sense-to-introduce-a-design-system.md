When you start developing a new product, many things have to be considered.
You have to be clear about the product vision, which target group to address, how the interface should appear, or how to guide and support the user.
Typically, these ideas are forged in product management, discussed and decided on a business level, and finally the development teams are in charge of crafting the product.
(Forgive me for oversimplifying this process - I am not a product manager ðŸ˜‰.)

## On the product development fast lane

As soon as the first considerations are made and the project is started, it seems as if things are going tremendously fast.
Before you know it, the backend reached it's MVP status, the designers made the font and color decisions, the developers selected the library for building the user interface, and UX has the first concepts in their pocket.
And when the first prototype is available, everybody does a happy dance.
All are enthusiastic about the new product approach, do research, contribute ideas, and take action.

## Wind of product change

But let's be honest with each other: things change over time.
New features are requested and need to be implemented, further teams are involved to top up development resources, or new colleagues join to help grow the product.
There might be also partners providing external applications to complete the feature set.
And let's face it: it may also happen that colleagues who know the product like the back of their hand are absent due to a longer sickness or have left the company.
And of course, we want to deliver a nice and sound product, right?
And clients should have a good time using it.

## Repeated questions

How do all the colleagues that develop the product further know about decisions that have been made?
I've heard people (including myself) discuss stuff like this:

* Why do we use a toggle here instead of a checkbox?
* How should we get the message across in the UI?
* Seriously? Is this the way we want to go from UX perspective?
* Can we expect our users to know this?
* How should I style this button?
* Which font do we use and what's the fallback?

## Design system to the rescue

Discussions about the above topics as well as questions that repeately come up could be avoided with a design system.
And what does that do exactly?
This is of course up to the company's needs, but should give the answers to those (and related) questions mentioned above.
Topics a design system might cover:

* collecting the elements (inventory) used in the UI 
* clear design guidelines for styling UI inventory (dimensions, fonts, padding...)
* when to use specific elements (use cases)
* 


## Let's do this right

Sure a design system is not what Santa brings.
It involves a huge amount of work and alignment of resources to establish this.
