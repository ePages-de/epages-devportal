In the blog post [What onboarding really is about](/blog/on-the-job/what-onboarding-is-really-about/), our Scrum Master colleague talks about our design thinking approach to create an onboarding tool which is geared towards the needs, inner thoughts and emotions of a newbie.
During the hackathon in March we were able to shape the idea and the first draft of it.
Since then (four and a half months ago) we worked further on the user-centered onboarding tool.
In the following I want to present our results so far and how the specific implementation aspects are linked to the user’s need (- at least what we think the users need is - next phase would be obviously to test our idea and product on our newbies!)

## “The excited but also insecure new employee...

During the define-phase of our design thinking approach suddenly it clicked for us, when we summarized our idea what the newbie feels, thinks, says or perceives and put it into a user story.
In that key moment - pah, let’s call it an enlightenment, an epiphany even - we realized: It is not mainly about the bunch of information we want to share with the newbie, it is about to make her feel welcome and part of the team on the one hand and on the other also being needed and self-effective.
So, to operate against the insecurity of our new employee we want to create an atmosphere in which she can learn and process all the information properly - including experiencing her first successes.
This discovery seems so simple and crystal clear, maybe even trivial to think of now.
But back then it prevented us from going in the wrong direction, to deluge the newbie with information and meetings - that’s why design thinking rocks!

## … has a need for social acceptance, … 

So after we settled that social acceptance and creating a warm welcome is way more important than an overload of pure information, we thought, that an individualized onboarding page, that is already prepared beforehand, is sending the right signal for the newbie.
The page is created in her personal space and can also be changed upon her needs. 

This beforehand preparation clearly demonstrates that we have been waiting for her and are happy to have her in our team and with us at epages.
Also, by assigning a buddy to her who can help in case she feels lost, we illustrate, that it’s okay and even wanted to ask questions and that we will support her wherever we can.
We want to have her here and make her integration into the epages family as smooth as possible ;)

## … structure, 

Of course, feeling welcome is crucial for a great start, but having all important information structured at ONE place, certainly also makes the life of a newbie way easier - without overwhelming her with the idea she needs to remember all the facts of the first weeks by heart!
Therefore, we have gathered all relevant information and divided it into sections which she can see at a glance: (1)Our general onboarding process, so that she knows what can be expected within the next weeks.
(2) Information about or company, like an organizational chart, our mission and benefits, (3) facts about our products (e.g. the vision & features) and processes like Scrum and Kanban, (4) as well as a description and the links of all the tools, we use in our daily business as for example our internal chat.
(5) Last but not least there is also a link to the team space the newbie is a new member of. 

## … and success, … 

To set individual goals is a prerequisite for success (or at least makes it measurable) and fosters the personnel development of the newbie.
On the individual onboarding page, we guide her through the goal setting process by e.g. encouraging her to self-reflect about her strengths and expectations.
As the onboarding page is individualized she can directly fill in her goals, update the current status of the goal’s achievement and discuss her progress with her manager (or restrict the permissions of the page, so that only she can see this).

## … because it is more important to feel self-effective than getting pure information.”

Feeling self-effective, secure and comfortable in one’s skin during the first days or weeks in a job position might sometimes be a bit hard, as you still have so many insecurities and new things to process.
To ease the situation we added short challenges to each section.
These enable a feeling of success from the start, help to learn and gain some practical experience in our tools and are also fun! For example to get familiar with our tools, the newbie has to create a new calendar entry for the next team lunch - yep, we’ve also come full circle with social acceptance here ;-) 

So, now we test our product and create for every new employee the personalized page and collect feedback. What are your experiences with onboarding your newbies?
