The Hackathon is a recurring entry in our calendars.
Each year we plan two days filled with interesting topics and lots of fun.
But what does it really mean to take part in our Hackathon?
Let me take you on a little time journey through the last month to give you some insights into the preparation and the event itself.

## Three weeks ago

It's getting serious guys.
We were asked to brainstorm about possible topics and to add them to a Confluence list.
These questions swirled through our minds:
- What would help us in our everyday office life?
- Which topic are on our I-always-wanted-to-work-on-that list?
- Which topics are great but didn't make it yet and might never make it to one of the teams' sprints?

My team member Birgit and I also brainstormed and added a topic to the list: Improving the [About us page](/about/) of the DevPortal.

## Two weeks ago

All topics were set and added to the list.
Now, it was time to decide which topic we'd like to join.
Let me tell you, it was a tough decision.
So many interesting but different topics.
Some of them aimed to improve our processes and workflows, such as a standardized on-boarding process, unified PR pipelines, a performance test, or a Circle CI wallboard.
Others had a closer look at our products and merchants, e.g. a UX check for integrating apps, an app for importing products via CSV, or an instore checkout.

These questions helped me to decide which topic I'd like to join:
- How can I support the team that is working on that topic?
- What will I learn when participating?
- Which team members will I have? 

Especially the last point was one of the most important ones for me.
A Hackathon is the perfect chance to work together with colleagues that I don't work with on a daily basis.
Maybe even with colleagues from different locations.
This way, we can even build little "feature teams" for the two days.

As Birgit covered the About us page, I took the chance to join a group which had the goal to categorize our merchants and their shops.
The results of such a categorization could help Product Management to make decisions on future features or improvements.
And of course, I also had my personal goal: Get some improvement ideas for our help articles.

## Last Wednesday

The time has come.
It's Hackathon!
And what could be the best way to start the first day?
Right - Breakfast!

The room was packed with ePagees.
Our colleagues from Jena, Barcelona, and Bilbao already arrived the day before and everyone was chatting... and eating.
Around 10 am the last buns and bagels disappeared, and our CTO officially kicked off the event.

During the rest of the day, everyone was diving into their topics, brainstorming, discussing, hacking, and prototyping.
When walking across the floor, I've seen many colored white boards and concentrated faces.

Around 6 pm one word was spread across the floor... PIZZA.
In no time, all teams came together and enjoyed the food.
While eating, I could already notice that many colleagues fell in love with their topics.
They were quite satisfied with their results and had big plans for the next day... or even the night.

## Last Thursday

Did I mention that we'll get Amazon vouchers for the first three groups?
No?
Well, now you'll understand that after so many satisfied colleagues on the last evening, my group was even more motivated to collect great results.
So, we continued hacking, discussing, and analyzing.
We got used to the tools, were able to improve our scripts, and shared our knowledge within our team.
And of course, we remembered that each team has a presentation slot at the end of the day.
No way, we prepared the slides in the last minutes because we were so into our tools and scripts.

At 4:30 pm all teams gathered into one of our biggest rooms.
It was time to share the results.
As we were nine groups, we had a tough time schedule:
Three minutes setup, five minutes presentation, and two minutes for questions.
Afterwards, everyone had three votes.

And the winner is... well, it would be a nice romantic-hollywood-movie-like ending for this post to tell you that my team won.
But we didn't ðŸ˜‰.
Instead, the standardized on-boarding process won, followed by our About us page (wohooo) and the instore checkout for our Beyond product.
For all other teams, the provided dinner was a pretty good consolation.
