It's R&D Day!! It was kicked off by Harm and followed by a fantastic workshop by Stefanie on the topic of Unconscious Bias. It was informative and interactive. I found it totally cool!
After lunch, I joined the "GitHub for Beginners" workshop with Birgit, Christina, and Paolo. I've been wanting to do this for a long time already, and the great thing is, that it is a practical workshop, not just theoretical. 

Here's our Joni Wieben presenting his Remote Working topic:
