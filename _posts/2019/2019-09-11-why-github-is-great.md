RnD Day!! It was opened by Harm and followed by a fantastic workshop by Stefanie on the topic of Unconscious Bias. It was informative and interactive. I found it totally cool!
After lunch, I joined the GitHub for Beginners Workshop with Birgit, Christina, and Paolo. I've been wanting to do this and the great thing is that it is a practical workshop, not just theoritical. 

Here's our Joni Wieben presenting his Remote Working topic:
