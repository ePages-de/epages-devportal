We, Carina and Elisa, are working as Scrum Masters at ePages in Jena and in Hamburg.
As many other ePagees we highly value the atmosphere at the offices, in which we feel comfortable to work and always welcome to speak out our minds.
That doesn’t mean that everything is always perfect and that there are no moments in which we are annoyed.
But we value each other’s opinion, we like spending time together - at work or even after work - and deeply care for each other.
In other words, our organizational culture, the way we are treating each other means a great deal for us.
But before we get into detail what is our organizational culture, we first have to clarify what this term even signifies.

## Organizational Culture …. wait, what?!

Based on an extended and open understanding of culture, the term refers to the human coexistence and interpersonal relationship.
Instead of perceiving culture as a complete, static entity, we understand culture as something dynamic: Through exchange and interaction with others, cultures are changing continuously.
Moreover, culture can be compared to an open network, which is fuzzy at its edges and may overlap with other networks.
That means, a person can be part of several lifeworlds – the own family, a circle of friends, a sports club or a specific working environment.
And this working environment itself is again multifaceted and dynamic.

As you already suspect by now, the organizational culture of ePages is also not a rigid, isolated and definite thing and by the way, in general not so easy to grasp.
We are rather talking about a composition of different identities, relations and even cultures of subgroups.
Looking to this complexity and multifaceted nature it’s no wonder that there are parts of the organizational culture that differs between locations, departments, teams and of course between people.

## What we value at ePages

When Elisa came from Hamburg to the ePages location in Jena to gain a deeper understanding of the work processes of our colleagues, she immediately noticed some visible differences in the offices.
She for herself perceived, for example the rooms and corridors are more spacious, lighter and kind of more welcoming in Jena, in the offices many green plants are found.
During lunch time many of the Jenaer colleagues meet in their social area to have lunch together on a big table and even cook together once or twice a week (if “making a salad” can be called cooking…).
With that you create an open and great atmosphere, you feel part of the group and connected to your colleagues and the organization.
Coming from Hamburg that was new for Elisa, because in the surroundings of the Hamburg office are many different restaurants from which you can choose your best option - often in smaller groups of colleagues.
Also, if you have brought your own lunch, you meet up occasionally in the smaller social area which is unfortunately more isolated from the rest of the office.
And of course, you also take your time for a short chit chat with your colleagues while waiting at the coffee machine or paying a visit to the other offices.
And we are sure that any other location of ePages also has their characteristics and peculiarities.
But those particular differences in the facilities and behaviour don‘t mean that community cohesion and solidarity is not important or valued in the other offices - itˋs just shown in a different way.
So, despite a variety in demonstrating them, our locations are based on the same core values.

Another example is commitment or engagement which are extremely esteemed at ePages - but again, maybe demonstrated in slightly different ways.
Whereas some of our colleagues regularly participate in conferences and thus are committed to ePages by constantly bringing new knowledge into the company, others express their engagement by for example actively fostering the recruitment of new colleagues.
They promote the company in their circle of acquaintances, seek the exchange with universities and are involved in job fairs.
And of course, it also takes a lot of commitment, to be willing to travel (and even fly!) to Hamburg every two to three weeks, to seek the personal exchange with the colleagues.

Ultimately, courage is not only one of the Scrum values, but also deeply rooted in our company culture.
Undoubtedly, it takes courage to do a review presentation in front of of all colleagues - and even more if you are not very confident in speaking English.
It takes courage to come up with doubts or unpopular proposals - and even more if they don’t concern your own working area.
Certainly, it also takes courage to prepare workshops, presentations or talks to participate in different company events.
Last but not least, it takes courage to change your work location for a longer time of period and on the other side to accept the new team member in your group - just as much as it takes to be the only ePagee at a certain location and thus only work remotely.

## What does this mean for us?

Due to the heterogeneity of ePages - our different career paths, locations, home countries and cities and many others - we have a multi-layered and wide-ranging organizational culture which results in great challenges and some complications on the one hand and huge enrichments and great potentials on the other.
In the end, what counts are the interpersonal relationships: When we encounter diverse behaviour, appearances or even rituals, we should not focus on the differences but see behind that.
What we need to do is to “renegotiate” our common culture, so that we are shaping it all together.
This can only succeed through more interaction between us, between the different locations, departments and the different teams.
It gives us the chance to learn from each other and find the common values that connect us.
We need to understand that each individual has different ways to demonstrate these values in his or her daily routine and that there is no definite right or wrong in doing so.
