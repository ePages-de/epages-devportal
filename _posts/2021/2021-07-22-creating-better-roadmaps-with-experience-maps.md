As a company developing products in a user centered way, we must rely on customer feedback in order to decide which features should be developed next.
This feedback comes from many different sources like direct customer interviews, customer support, external partners our own consulting department or from other stakeholders like marketing and sales.

## The problem of collecting feedback and creating roadmaps

We are collecting this feedback throughout Jira tickets, which are created by the feedback owner and later analyzed by product management.
Doing this we faced the problem, that the feedback often was insufficiently described and missing important details about why a certain feature is needed by the user.
Furthermore, the feedback was not really sorted and it was very hard to distinguish to which part of our software a feedback is related and how many users are actually affected by it.
Sometimes feedback tickets were even created double and triple because the feedback owners were not able to find the original ticket inside the huge collection of feedback.

As also our roadmap is based on this feedback, this led to the situation, that every 3 months when it was time to create the new roadmap, we couldn’t easily detect where customers had the most problems or which features where actually the ones most urgently needed.
Therefore, we as a product management team had to have a lot of discussions with all stakeholders where we tried to find out what in their eyes would be the most urgent needed features and to have them commit to the afterwards created roadmap which was never easy as everyone had a different opinion on what would be the next most urgent thing to develop.

## Learnings from UX

As user experience professionals we are used to work with feedback and to do research to find out how certain features should be designed in order to make them as easy as possible to use and understandable for the user.
As this is the common approach in UX Design we thought that it should also work on a product management level when it is about to decide on the direction and the next features to be developed for our products.

We came up with the idea of using experience maps.
Those maps are similar to customer journey maps which are used in the field of UX to visualize how users are working with a product or a specific feature and how they experience it.
Experience maps would help us to organize the already existing feedback.
To merge feedback which is shared by different users to break it apart and analyze and show the different goals, activities, touchpoints, pain points and thoughts of our users.

## Structure and transparency

The result is a living document maintained by product management, which shows the current state of our products in a way where it is easy for everyone in the company to identify the most common problems and pain points of our users.
Furthermore, it gives us as the product management team a great source from which we can deduct upcoming roadmaps.
It helps us to develop new feature ideas or feature optimizations based on the pain points and problems and to prioritize them as it is also possible to distinguish between more rare and more common feedback which is shared by a lot of users.

Once the new roadmap is created, we can use the experience map again to visualize it and allow everyone to trace back any roadmap item to the underlaying user goals and pain points which explains the reason why it should be developed next.

## Summary 

Experience maps are a great tool to analyze, structure and visualize feedback and generally the current state of a product from a user’s point of view.
They can help prioritizing new developments and generally enhance the user centered mindset of the company as everyone can see where the users are struggling of which goals, they are trying to achieve with the product.
