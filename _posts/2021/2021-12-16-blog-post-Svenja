On December 02 and 03, I participated in the Tomorrow Academy's "Graphic Design Innovation Lab" workshop.
In the following I would like to share and deepen some impressions and lingering thoughts.

## The speakers and the workshop

The twins Thomas and Martin Poschauko are multidisciplinary universal creatives who combine the fields of liberal arts, design, creative research and academic teaching.
As designers they work for clients such as Sony Music, Kieler Woche, Deutsche Post, the band Labrassbanda, the Federal Ministry of Finance or the product design label Auerberg (graphic design, corporate identity, illustration, music design).
The authors of the multiple award-winning book ["Nea Machina - die Kreativmaschine"](https://www.poschauko.de/neamachina/){:target="_blank"} give seminars, hold lectures on the subject of "creativity" and explore the creative process in their experiments.
As this creative consultants they already worked together with companys as MetaDesign, Red Bull, Ferrero, Maloja, Georg Thieme Verlag, Strichpunkt Design and ServusTV.
For more information and insights into their work, please visit their [website](https://www.poschauko.de/){:target="_blank"}.

The workshop started for me a few days before the actual date.
I received a large package, which contained not only all the important things for the workshop, but also some great little gifts, such as snacks and drinks.

During the workshop, the Poschaukos succeeded in explaining and communicating their complex technical setup and their innovative method, which was developed together with Adidas, in a way that was understandable and also implementable at home.
Afterwards, in addition to a lot of valuable input, a time of trying out and experimenting followed.
For ages I had a pair of scissors and a tape in hand to create something artistic. 

Before the workshop it was said "We believe: Ideas arise in the simplest way while making (...)
The goal: The creative process becomes more noticeable, faster and more intuitive.
And is suddenly really fun again!" And they were right! It was really fun to just try things out freely.
All of a sudden, real ideas and solutions came out of it without me really looking for them.
Here are some of my final results that came out of it:

During the workshop and also afterwards I felt a much stronger creavitity.
I had a great desire to run to my desk and try out more things.
That's when I started to wonder - why was this happening all of a sudden? For a long time this thought lingered, and therefore I would like to take the opportunity here to deepen this.

## What is creativity?

Creativity is something we have all heard before.
Maybe one or two of you have caught yourself thinking "I can't do this.
I'm not that creative!" But is that true? What does creativity actually mean?

Creativity doesn't just mean painting beautiful pictures, writing exciting novels, or making great music.
Creativity manifests itself in thinking, acting and planning and is elementarily important for human development.
Being creative means changing perspectives or taking different paths.
Therefore, creativity is basically comparable to problem solving.

Think back to your own childhood or maybe you observe it with your own children: Children are bubbling over with creativity.
Kids are full of creativity.
They explore everything, try things out, look at them in different ways, combine them and interpret them in thousand ways.
A toilet paper roll is used to build a spaceship, a chestnut becomes a manikin, and a fork becomes a catapult.

## Where is this childish creativity now?

In a study in the 1960s, George Land discovered that 98% of all children are highly creative by the age of 5.
Unfortunately, this rate decreases with higher age.
Among the 10 year olds it was only 30%, among the 15 year olds 12% and with an average age of 31 years only 2% were among the creative geniuses.
In his [TED Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfKMq-rYtnc&ab_channel=TEDxTalks){:target="_blank"}, Land gives some interesting context and background information on this.

## Can we reawaken the five-year-old in us?

The results of the study may be shocking, but don't worry: Land and many other scientists agree that creativity is something we can learn.
You can think of creativity as a muscle.
It needs to be stimulated frequently in order to grow and loses strength if it is not used.

> “Creativity is just connecting things.
> When you ask creative people how they did something, they feel a little guilty because they didn’t really do it, they just saw something.
>It seemed obvious to them after a while.” - Steve Jobs

The speakers at the "Graphic Design Innovation Lab" workshop also communicated this.
Their core message is fundamentally that everything can be inspiration.
To do this, you just have to learn to leave the usual points of view behind and be open to everything new.
But this is a process over time, not something that just happens overnight.
But as soon as you get used to it, your sensitivity for your environment increases every day.
The Poschauko brothers have internalized this view so much that everything that surrounds them has become inspiration for their innovative designs.

But how is that supposed to work? The first thing we have to learn is to get rid of our analytical way of thinking for a while.
By simply doing and writing down what comes to our minds, we open ourselves to inspiration.
It is very important that we do not evaluate these things directly.
Because then we switch back to an analytical mindset and shout out our creativity.
Of course, in our working world, we can't spend all our time mindlessly trying things out and playing around.
We need to find a balance here.
But keep in mind: if we constantly create small spaces for ourselves to live out our creativity, not only our working life but also our well-being will benefit.

At the end of this topic, a little exercise for creativity: Let's go back to the fork that used to be a catapult.
Can you think of 20 more uses for the fork? Can you imagine that this fork could even be the inspiration and model for a modern logo design?

## Summary

Want to learn how to rediscover your creativity?
Are you interested in a highspeed prototype method that allows you to create professional and innovative designs in a very short time?
Then I can highly recommend the Tomorrow Academy's "Graphic Design Innovation Lab” workshop.

For me attending the workshop was like a little treasure chest full of useful tools, inspiration and new things.
The speakers were friendly , professional and always very helpful.
Their passion and creativity was infectious.
There was a good balance of new input, trying it out yourself, breaks and evaluation.
Especially with the small group of 8 people, everyone was able to contribute and get enough feedback.
All in all, the two days felt like a little vacation for heart and soul, in which I also learned a lot for my job and everyday life.
