Incremental and iterative software development is part of the agile DNA but it’s also a perfect way for small and medium companies to develop user focused and in the same time resource conserving.
Development teams will ship as soon as possible valuable increments of a feature to the user.
Based on feedback functionalities will be added to these increments.
This leads to a growing product with features that are used and demanded by users and a constant circle of delivered increments and improvements.
But how do you define the scope of a feature you want to add on?
That’s one of the most important tasks of product management.

## Collect and sort requirements and define a MVP

Every company has different sources where they gather feedback regarding requirements people wish to have in the software.
First of all – of course - there are the users because they are the people that elaborate on a daily base with your product.
They know exactly what parts of the product they like but also which kinds of functionality they are sorely missing.
Beside the users of course there are in addition requirements from other stakeholders, like external partners or the management which need some set of features for business and strategical reasons.

All these requirements have to be collected, sorted and prioritized – which is mostly a task product management is responsible for.
Story mapping can be a good methodology to find out which parts of a feature are essential (core functionality) and which are needed to add additional value for customers.

The MVP build from that can be the first increment that is shipped to a customer.
It’s the first iteration of that feature that gets into the product.
The goal here is to define a piece of software that is small enough to be shipped in a short timeframe but on the other side still has enough functionality to still give value to the customer.
An example to demonstrate this: adding a price to a product might be one of the most important functionalities when it comes to product setup in an ecommerce software, but it does not give the user a real value as long as he is not able to also update the price later on.

## Ship and listen to your users

Once you shipped your feature to the customers the iterative cycle of developing it further starts.
You have again to listen to your users and stakeholders, collect feedback, sort and prioritize.
Often it turns out that functionalities you, personally, would have seen in the next iteration of that feature will get deprioritized because your customers find other things more important.
Also, outer circumstances may change like the lockdowns during corona times.

## Extend the feature and grow the product

The incremental and iterative approach will not only help you to deliver continuously valuable functionalities for your user and with that grow your product.
It also gives you the change in each iteration to improve and learn from former iterations.
Increments don’t necessarily have to be an add-on in functionality but can also be UX improvements or restructuring existing software parts.
And this - as mentioned above – a great way to go for small and medium sized software companies.
Instead of constantly deliver one feature after another which they would not have the manpower to do so, they have the chance by carefully listening to deliver the functionalities their customers need.
This will lead to a well-structured and good product instead of feature bloat.

## Skills needed to go down that road

Companies that want to go down that road of incremental and iterative software development will need an agile mindset – of course.
Also, it has to be ensured in the development that the iterative approach does not mean that the increments do not need to have a good quality.

But first and most of all it’s important to have a good understanding of the wishes and needs of your customers (that could be users as partners).
You have to agree that you truly want to listen carefully to the feedback you get – even if it contradicts with the things YOU would see as important in the product.
This is not only true for product management but also for each department in the company, including development teams, marketing and sales.
In the long run a product that is successful within his target group of users will also be the one that will serve best business interests.
