So, I am quite sure you have already heard about Github Actions.
It is Github‚Äôs solution for automating workflows.
You can basically automate anything that can be triggered via a Github repository‚Äôs events: add/remove tags, create/close PR, etc. ([here](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/events-that-trigger-workflows){:target="_blank"} is a complete list).

{% image_custom image="/assets/img/pages/blog/images/github-actions-logo.png" width="50" %}

Here are some reasons why Github Actions could be a good choice:
- The price is competitive ($0.008 per Linux minutes as of Dec/2021)
- It fully integrates into Github (if you use it for hosting your repos)
- YAML config ‚Üí this means changes can be reviewed
- It has a marketplace with many ready-to-use Actions (triggering a webhook, for example)

## Great, but let‚Äôs talk about only one of its uses

Of course, this means that you can use it to create your own build pipeline.
You can build, test and even deploy your service via Github Actions, you just need to know which commands to run.

### How we do it

In the case of our services, most are running with Gradle, so building it is really a no-brainer.
Here are the steps needed for the build process of main branch builds (the ones which get deployed):
- Compile and run unit/integration tests (`./gradlew build`)
- Build and push a Docker image
- Build and publish a Helm chart

Quite straightforward, nothing fancy.
We have set up Github Actions to run the build process in two different ocasions:
- On Pull Requests (run tests).
- When a PR is merged into the main branch.

### Down to the code

Here is an adapted version of our build‚Äôs YAML file (located within the `.github/workflows` directory):
```yaml
name: Build and test

on:
  push:                                 #######
    branches: [ main, '*-test' ]        ## 1 ##
  pull_request:                         #######
    branches: [ '*' ]

concurrency:                            #######
  group: ${{ github.ref }}              ## 2 ##
  cancel-in-progress: true              #######

env:
  # Gradle variables                                                              #######
  ORG_GRADLE_PROJECT_dockerHubUsername: ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_USER }}             ## 3 ##
  ORG_GRADLE_PROJECT_dockerHubPassword: ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_PASSWORD }}         #######

jobs:
  build:
    name: Build / test / docker image üê≥
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2                               ### 4
      - name: Set up JDK 11                                     ### 5
        uses: actions/setup-java@v2
        with:
          java-version: 11
          distribution: 'temurin' # adopt openjdk
          cache: gradle
      - name: Gradle test                                       ### 6
        run: ./gradlew --no-daemon check asciidoctor

      ### THE FOLLOWING STEPS ARE FOR MASTER BUILDS ONLY

        uses: docker/login-action@v1                                                #######

        run: bash -c './src/deploy/ci/package-helm-chart.sh'                        ########
```
Let‚Äôs break it down:
1. As already mentioned, a ‚Äúworkflow‚Äù, as it is called, is triggered by a specific event.
    In the case of this workflow, it is triggered on two events:
    a. When a Pull Request is created for any branch
    b. When commits are pushed to the ‚Äúmain‚Äù branch or to any branches ending with ‚Äú-test‚Äú.
2. This section controls when builds should be canceled.
    In this case it makes sure that we have only one running build per PR.
    When multiple commits are pushed in a short period of time, only the last one gets built.
3. Section where we load the environment variables.
    There we load Dockerhub username/password with repository secrest for use with Gradle.
4. Here the setting up is already done and we start running commands.
    First, we must checkout the repository.
5. After that we need to set up the JDK.
    The "setup-java" action allows us to specifcy a few parameters, among which is the JDK's version.
6. Use Gradle to test our project, and also generate API documentation (`asciidoctor`)
7. Here starts the part that does not run on PR builds.
    This is achieved with the `if` conditional: `github.ref == 'refs/heads/master'`.
    With this conditional we make sure that this step only runs on the `master` branch.
8. The build generates some artifacts that we need to publish (`jar` files, etc.)
9. This step is actually suggested by github so that dependencies are not cached.
10. We start another job here that will package a Helm chart, which runs inside a container of a custom image.
    Credentials for pulling this image must be provided, because it is a private image.
11. Then we run our shell script which edits some files, builds, and then publishes the helm chart.

## Advanced topics

The goal of this article is to be a quick start: to give you a basic skeleton so that you can start using it for your own projects.
Github Actions has much more functionality which we don't cover here, for example: custom actions, providing generated data to downstream jobs, etc.
I encourage you to go over to their website and read a bit more about it.

## NOTE

I also would to make clear that Github Actions is only one of many build tools (really, a whole lot) out there.
Gitlab also has their own [CI solution](https://about.gitlab.com/stages-devops-lifecycle/continuous-integration/){:target="_blank"}, there is also [Semaphore](https://semaphoreci.com/){:target="_blank"}, [Drone](https://www.drone.io/){:target="_blank"}, [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/){:target="_blank"}, [Circle CI](https://circleci.com/){:target="_blank"}... just to name a few.
