Some time has passed by now. So, I was wondering what has changed in the meantime: How many #womenintech do we have? What are the top 3 programming languages our developers are using? That’s why I’ve talked to our software developers, designers, UX experts, technical writers, POs, and scrum masters (again). Here’s the updated version of who we are and what we stand for:
