We've already explained in our previous blog posts how agile working at ePages looks like, e.g. [how Scrum is used at ePages](/blog/methods-and-tools/epages-turns-agile/), [what it's like to be an agile technical writer](/blog/methods-and-tools/what-its-like-to-be-an-agile-technical-writer/), or [how to introduce new employees to Scrum](/blog/methods-and-tools/how-to-introduce-new-employees-to-scrum/).
But have you ever wondered how the daily work of a Scrum Master looks like and which challenges they meet?
Yes?
Me too. üôãüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è 
That's why I decided to do an interview with one of our Scrum Masters from Jena.

## Moin Miri, thank you for taking the time for this interview. Let's start with your journey to ePages: What's your background and your job position at ePages?

Hello, my name is Miriam, but everyone calls me Miri.
I started in November 2019 as a Scrum Master at ePages.
In order to tell you how I became a Scrum Master, and how I became a ePagee, I need to go into a little more detail - it's kind of a funny story.
So, I did my Master degree in Intercultural Personnel Development and Organisational Development in Jena.
The study included various topics: from digital work to agile work, and new work in combination with psychological concepts.
Originally, my plan was to work in the field of personnel development.
So, I applied for internship at a e-commerce software company in the field of personnel development.
My main tasks at this internship were to organize and to support employee trainings as well as communication trainings.
But how the agile world is, when I started my internship, my mentor changed from personnel development to Scrum and took the role as a product owner.
Due to this change, my mentor couldn't serve me anymore in the field of personnel development.
So, I changed to Scrum as well, but worked together with the Scrum Masters.
This was my first contact with the field of Scrum Master.
In the beginning it was a lot of new stuff to learn because in my study I did not learn Scrum in core.
Nevertheless, this topic was very interesting and exciting to me.
During my internship I got a deeper insight into Scrum and agile work which I really liked.
I kept this internship, and I wrote my master thesis also in the field of Scrum.
During my study I got to know a former ePages employee who studied with me.
She told me that ePages is looking for a Scrum Master and if I would be interested.
This was the perfect job opportunity after my internship.
I applied and started as a Scrum Master at ePages.


## What are your tasks at ePages, and how many teams do you support? 

My task area is very diverse.
A big part of my work is working together with the teams.
Currently, I'm supporting in total two teams in Jena.
But in my two teams are also team members who work remotely from Bratislava and Leipzig.
My aim is to ensure that my teams can work undisturbed in a harmonic environment without any conflicts.
If there are any conflicts, I try to adress them, and remove them as soon as possible.
Organisational development is a big task as well, which includes organizing and hosting e.g. the Daily or Retrospectives.
There are some important points I have to consider as a Scrum Master: listen to the team, meet the needs of the team, and building trust to the teams.
But my work as a Scrum Master is not only limited to working with the teams.
The Scrum Master's objective is to encourage team work also across our different locations.
Our task is for example to coordinate that the teams work cross-functional, to handle communication bareers, to avoid miscommunications between the individual teams, and to support the teams in order to work better together.
We do not only work with the RnD teams, but also with other teams like Project Management, Marketing, HR, and Sales in order to develop new team processes.
Thus, we would like to ensure that the whole company moves into the same direction.

## Could you tell us how your typical work day looks like?

Actually, each day as a Scrum Master is different.
You never know what the day will bring. 
So, there's no typical work day, and that's what I like a lot about my job.
But I will try to explain how my "typical" work day looks like.
My day starts at 7.30 a.m. at ePages.
First, I get a coffee and try to exchange with other colleagues in the kitchen to keep me updated.
Then, I return back to my desk to check my e-mails and messages.
Afterwards, I priotize my tasks for the day to get a better overview.
At 9.15 a.m. we have our Scrum Master Daily Meeting where I exchange with the other Scrum Master from Hamburg, for example about ongoing topics in the teams.
Half an hour later I have the Daily with my teams.
After the Daily and before my lunch break, I try to work on my tasks, which I priotized in the morning.
I spent my lunch break usally together with the team.
Sometimes we meet in our social room to eat together, or we go outside to have lunch.
Sometimes we even cook together.
For example, this week I will prepare Kaiserschmarrn (since I am originally from Austria) for the whole team. 
The afternoon is often different, depending on if we have a Sprint change or not.
If we have a Sprint change, I spent the day with planning Reviews, and Retrospectives.
Otherwise, I work on organisational development tasks, or on cross-team tasks.

## What is one of the biggest challenges of your job, and how do you handle it?

One challenge for me at the moment is working together with teams who actually do something completely different than me.
Since I am relatively new in this technical field, my level of knowledge in tech is not that deep, yet.
Part of my job is to intervene into team discussions, if the discussions get out of hand.
Sometimes it's not that easy for me to determine when I should step into a discussion: So, is the technical topic the team is discussing about really relevant for them, or is it just a random tech topic they discuss about?
Of course it would be easier for me if they would talk about a topic which I'm understanding in core.
What I do to handle such situations is to ask the team directly, what the topic is about, and if it is important for us.
But compared to the beginning, I understand now much more - everything step by step.

## How do you cooperate with your Scrum Master colleagues from Hamburg? Are you in regular exchange with them?

So, yes I'm in regular exchange with the Scrum Masters in Hamburg.
We have a remote Scrum Master Daily each morning.
This meeting is especially for me very important, because I'm the remote person.
Since I'm not directly in Hamburg, I don't get all important information right away. 
This makes it so much more important to stay in touch with the Scrum Masters in Hamburg. 
The Daily helps us all a lot to keep us updated. 
Furthermore, the Scrum Masters in Hamburg have a board where they collect important and current topics they discussed about. 
Once or twice a week we're meeting remote and work on the collected topics together. 
And if there are any question from my side, I have always the opportunity to call them. 
The cooperation works very well.

## What do you like about ePages?

What I really like about ePages, and what I appreciate is the work atmosphere.
It's very familiar and you get to know all employees.
We prepare lunch together, go for a walk, or start other excursions like e.g. ice scating.
And as I'm not from Jena, it is great to work in a company where you feel familiar.
The colleagues are very kind and respectful to each other.
Furthermore, I like the flat hierachies - you never have the feeling that anyone is standing above or below you.

## Do you have a favorite Retrospective?

Actually, I do not have that one favorite Retrospective.
But one retro I liked a lot is one which took place outside.
Once we had all team members together in Jena, including the members who work remotely.
And in order to connect them a little better, we took a walk together to the Fuchsturm Jena (a castle tower), and had lunch.
We did the retro on our way to the restaurant and our way back from the restaurant.
The team was split into several smaller groups.
Each group got some questions which they had to discuss in their group, to get to know each other better.
During the walk the groups changed.
In the end each team member had to tell us what they've learned.
On the one hand, it was a cool retro because we were outside, and catched some fresh air.
On the other hand, it especially improved the relationship of the team members who work remotely.
