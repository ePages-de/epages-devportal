Throughout the year, ePages is not only joining various [events](/events/) such as conferences and meetups, but also some job fairs for interested developers and students.
At ePages, our HR team is taking care of these job fairs and organizes them. 
In the following interview, our HR Managers Elisa and Katharina will tell us why it is so important for them to visit job fairs and what they have experienced so far.
