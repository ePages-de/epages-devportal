It is called a picture is worth a thousand words - Instagram is the perfect social media platform for sharing visuals around the worlld.
We started our Instagram channel @life_at_epages in 2019 to present our company culture and express thus who we are. 
But managing a company Instagram channel and coordinating content, involves some important aspects to consider.
In the following I will explain which actions we take in order to keep our company Instagram channel alive.

## Create Instagram How-to guide 

Usually, an Instagram company channel is not run by a single employee but by a team consisting of two or more persons.
In order to develop and create consistent content for our Instagram channel, we created an Instagram How-to guide. 
This guide shows the employees an overview of how to use Instagram at ePages and is continuously being updated.  

- Aim of Instagram channel
Write down what you want to reach with the Instagram channel and in which areas the channel should support the company.
Should it support you more in promoting your company product, should it support you in reaching out to potential hires, or should it support you more in gaining traffic on your blog.

- Target group
Define your target group: Write down the groups you would like to reach with your Instagram channel as well as groups which not belong to your target group.
This makes it more clear for the employees which group of persons you would like to reach out to.
Thus, you can orient your content towards your defined target group.

- Content Ideas 
List in a table content ideas that show which kind of content is suitable for your Instagram channel, e.g. internal & external events, employee portraits, or team activities.
Furthermore, you can specify the content ideay by describing them.
For example, write down which external events you want to visualize - is it only conferences, or fairs as well?
This table is a reminder for content ideas and shows in which direction you can move with the content. 

- Hashtags 
Note hashtags that are suitable for your Instagram captions and sort them into different categories.
Use different kind of hashtags such as company-branded hashtags, company wide hashtags, or location hashtags.
Our company-branded hashtags are #lifeatepages or #itsepages.
Besides that write down some more general hashtags such as #yoga or #companyculture, and location hashtags such as #hamburg or #paris.
Thus, your account can be found also from a wider audience.

## Create an agenda for events and fairs 

Throughout the year ePages is organizing internal events such as our hackathon, our Sales Kick-off event, or the ePages YOU, but also participating in external events such as conferences and fairs.
These events can also provide perfect content for your company Instagram channel.
In order to keep them in mind create an agenda where you list all internal and external events.
List also which team or employees the external events are visiting.
Thus, you can remind them in time to take some nice pictures from the event.

## Create a content plan 

In order to coordinate your content on Instagram you can create a content plan. 
This is actually a calender where you can coordinate your content: So, which picture do you want to share when?
This makes it easier for you to plan your content sharing in advance.
We created a content plan at the start of our Instagram channel. 
But it didn't work for us.
We're a little channel and are very flexible with sharing our content.
So, we're deciding each week what content we would like to share on Instagram.
But we still keep it mind - it might support us in the future.

## Consistent visual presentation
Consider a consistent visual presentation of the Instagram feed.
