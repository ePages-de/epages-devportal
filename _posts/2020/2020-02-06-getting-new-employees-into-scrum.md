ePages is already [working agile for several years](/blog/methods-and-tools/epages-turns-agile/){:target="_blank"}.
In an agile company, it is important that the employees know what Scrum means, and also how agile is lived at ePages.
But just explaining Scrum to new employees in two or three sentences has maybe not the biggest learning effect.
That's why the Scrum Masters at ePages do an extra session introducing new employees to Scrum during their onboarding time.
Starting as a working student at ePages, I never experienced the Scrum framework in a company before.
So, for me it was a great opportunity to learn more about Scrum.
But how does a Scrum session for new employees look like?

## Introduction

The Scrum session was hosted by a Scrum Master of ePages who organized the whole session.
In total four new employees participated â€“ three employees from our Hamburg office and one employee from our office in Jena.
Since the session was hold in Hamburg, our employee from Jena participated remotely via Google Hangouts.
We were a mixed group of Developers and Technical Writers.
In the beginning of the session all participants including our Scrum Master introduced themselves shortly:

- What's your name?
- Which job position do you have and what's your background?
- Which team do you belong to and what are your tasks?

## Learning by playing

Only sitting there for an hour and listen to what Scrum is about would be way too boring.
So, what our Scrum Master prepared was a little game in the beginning.
We as a team got the following task: We got a double deck of cards (each deck of cards contains 52 cards) which we had to sort by card colour (red and black), card type (hearts, diamonds, spades and clubs) and order their card value from low (one) to high (ace).
Our colleague in Jena got half a deck of cards to keep it fair.
Before we started to sort the cards, we had to discuss in the team how much time we think we will need for the task.
Then we had two minutes time to discuss in the team how to solve the task:

- Who is doing what?
- How we do proceed?
- With which strategy do we solve the task (in) the best possible way?

After we clarified our strategy, we started to sort the cards and our Scrum Master measured the time.
In the first round neither we solved the task in the estimated time, nor we sorted all cards in the correct order.
We played three rounds in total.
After each round we talked about where our mistakes have been, how we can avoid the mistakes and how we can improve our strategy.
From round to round we not only improved our strategy but also needed less time to solve the task with a high quality.
So, this little game showed us in a practical way how the Scrum process works.
In simple terms: You get a task, you estimate how much time you're going to need to get the task done, and you're working on the task during the estimated time. 
Then you try to find out where your mistakes have been, but also what went well. 
Afterwards you think about how to improve the task process and how to solve it the best way.

## What is Scrum? - A short summary

The Scrum game covered in a fun way many Scrum Events (e.g. planning, sprint, review, retrospective) which are necessary to create transparency and to enable inspection and adaption.
Following the game, our Scrum Master explained in detail what Scrum is about at ePages.
In this theoretical part, the participants were also actively integrated.
We discussed for example how we would define the role of a Scrum Master, what the role of a Product Owner is, or which methods are used in our own team. 
Here's a short summary of the most important points that were mentioned in the Scrum session:

### Scrum

Scrum is a framework for project and product management which is used amongst others for software development.
This framework can be used especially for complex kind of works.

### Scrum Roles

- The **Scrum Master** is a kind of a coach who supports the team. She or he moderates the team, supports the team in coming up with their own decisions and removes impediments. Furthermore, the Scrum Master checks the work process and if Scrum is practiced according to the Scrum Guide.
- The **Product Owner** creates a vision and strategy for products and develops the direction of the product with the team. So, what the team is going to do next and how they are going to do it. She or he tries to understand the customer requirements and thus maximize the value of the product. Furthermore, the Product Owner coordinates the tasks, creates tickets and prioritizes them.
- The **Developer Team** is ideally a cross functional and self-organized team which includes all functions needed to build working increments of the product.

### Scrum Artefacts

- In the **Product Backlog** all requirements are listed which have to be done. The more important a task is, the more clearly the task should be described. So the team exactly knows what is meant by the task. After each Sprint the tasks in the Backlog will be updated, evaluated and sorted by importance. The important tasks are on the top of the list.
- The **Sprint Backlog** is a board where the tasks from the Backlog are listed as soon as the tasks are getting in your workflow. This board shows the plan for the next sprint. For example, the Scrum Board of the Tech Writing team at ePages is divided into five different status: To do, On hold, In progress, Review and Done.

### Scrum Events 

- The **Daily Scrum** is a 15-minute meeting which takes place every day. Each team member explains in his team usually with their Scrum Master and Product Owner what he or she did since the last meeting, what the plan for the following day is, and if there's anything which is blocking the team member. This event is to coordinate the work for the following working day.
- A **Sprint** at ePages is a two-week time period during which the selected tickets with the tasks from the Backlog have to be done by the team.
- A **Review** takes place after each Sprint. The teams are presenting which new functions they implemented during their Sprint.
- A **Retrospective** takes place usually right after a Review. The team discusses with their assigned Scrum Master which things went well and which things didn't go well during their Sprint and what could be improved.

## My impression

It was a really fun introduction into Scrum.
Especially integrating the participants actively into the session was very exciting.
The Scrum session definitely helped me to understand better how an agile company works and how Scrum is used at ePages.
Furthermore, a nice side effect is that you get to know your new colleagues a little better - or even get to know colleagues you haven't met yet. ðŸ˜Š
