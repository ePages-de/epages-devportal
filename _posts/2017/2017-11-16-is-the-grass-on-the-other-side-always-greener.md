You are already an old hand in your company?
Or you are looking for a change and new experiences?
Many employees consider a job change in this case.
One of our colleagues felt the same and decided to leave... but she came back after a few weeks.
The reasons to leave, the experiences she made during this time and the reasons to come back will be presented in the following interview.

### Hey Romy. We are glad to have you back on board! Can you tell us more about your main reason to leave ePages?

I really loved my colleagues, my tasks and the overall working atmosphere.
So, to be honest, it was a tough decision.
I am always up for new processes and mindsets because being up-to-date is really important to me.
In one point of time, I noticed that there is so much more to know and so many other ways to work in my field.
I just wanted to make sure that I don't miss anything and get stuck.
That's why I left - with sadness in my heart but willing to earn new expertise.

### Why did you come back?

One might think that coming back after such a short time feels like a failure or a step back.
But that's not true for me.
I liked my new job and my new colleagues and I really learnt great new stuff und was able to gain new expertise.
There are no bad things to tell about the other company.
But it was not like ePages - a different feeling - no coming home.
I've been "the new one in class".
You might say that this is how it is when you start a new job.
But when my phone rang, and ePages asked if I would be willing to come back, I didn't think twice.
I had too high expectations and to be honest, I never gave the other company a chance.

The main reason to leave has been my fear to miss something and to stagnate.
Due to that, the most important aspect for me was that ePages didn't offer me my old job.
They were looking for a different position.
This means I could broaden my knowledge through different tasks than before.
So, it was no step back but a new chance.
A new chance in the company I already missed after I closed the door behind my back.

### How does your new daily working day look like?

Before I left, I was responsible for all kind of human resources management.
Like for example payrolls.
My new main task is being a [recruiter](/blog/on-the-job/behind-the-scenes-technical-recruiting-at-epages/).
This means that there are some old tasks but also some new ones.
The perfect match.
The great thing about being a recruiter is that you can support new employees from the first second on.
I am responsible to create an [onboarding](/blog/on-the-job/5-steps-to-make-you-feel-comfortable-in-your-new-job/) that facilitates their start.
They should feel like part of the ePages family and be happy to go to work.
Additionally, it's like being the bouncer of ePages ðŸ˜‰.
I am already looking forward to this new challenge and to all the new [future employees](/devjobs/) I will talk to.

### Do you have any advice for people who are in the same situation?

It doesn't matter in which company you work or in which field, there will always be some people complaining about money, missing communication or responsibility.
If you truly believe in that, you should leave.
But before that you should ask yourself three questions:
- Do I really want such a big change?
- What do I expect from it?
- What are my reasons to leave?

And you should think twice about the benefits of your current company.
Maybe you take some things for granted and are not really aware of it.
For example, you need to understand that not every idea can be realized or that the working atmosphere is more familiar than it would be somewhere else.
Thinking about that, you might find out that you do not really want to quit.
That you are only looking for new challenges or want to broaden your knowledge.
In this case, you should consider other possibilities.
So, look around, talk to your manager and have a look if you can change your position in your current company.
But most important, you need to find a solution that gives you a good feeling.
Go for it!

### Thank you for these interesting insights Romy!
