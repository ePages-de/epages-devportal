A good wording is crucial for a good software product.
Well yes, it is not all.
Of course, the software behind it needs to be built and work properly.
But imagine, you play around with a new technically flawless software and you don't understand how things work and where to find them.
Or one function is named differently throughout the software.
In this case, UI-writers messed up and you will never touch the software again (unless you have to).
To avoid this, our UI-writers do their best to ensure a nice user experience, and thus happy users.
I sneaked into on of their wording sessions and figured out, what they keep in mind, and what is needed to create an awesome wording in our three internally provided languages.

## See the big picture

Without context it is really tough to create an appropriate wording.
In our case, we often have one-word-strings.
One word.
Sometimes you don't even know if this word is a subject or a verb.
So how should you be able to translate this word into other languages?
For this reason, we decided to work with the software localization tool [PhraseApp](https://phraseapp.com/){:target="_blank"}.
With the help of PhraseApp's [In-Context Editor](http://demo.phraseapp.com/){:target="_blank"} we are now able to see and translate the single strings directly in our software.
So taking into account the context: Check!

## Benefit of a good memory

Having a look at the context is not enough. You also need to keep in mind, how you worded the same kind of text before.
This way, you can come up with consistent and understandable UI-texts.
Of course, Translation Memories can help to tackle this task.
But they do not always show every result and (most of the time) do not take into account syntax similarities or content overlaps.
Thus, it helps if you are able to remember what you already did before.
So, stay concentrated, don't forget the past, and benefit from the work you already did.

## Create your own guidelines

Taking the time to come up with some guidelines for the UI will help you tremendously.
Yes, it will take some time in the beginning.
And yes, you need quite a few people for it, like colleagues from UX and design.
BUT after this initial step, the guideline will simplify your wording tasks every single time.
Once you chose a set structure for text types, decide how to apply grammar rules and how to combine images and texts, you can do the wording better and faster.
Additionally, your texts will be consistent and coherent.

## Be aware that you might need to do QA

Ideally, you do the wording at the end of the development process.
After UX and design are discussed and implemented.
But there will be cases where the communication was not completely perfect.
So, when you are thinking about the wording and playing around in the software to understand how everything is connected and what texts stands for, you might come across some issues that are not perfectly implemented from UX and UI perspective.
There is only one way to solve these issues: communication!
Talk to the product owner or deverlopers and have a look if the software can be changed accordingly.

## Look for a sparing partner

Working in a team means you are more creative, you decrease the risk of slips and you can benefit from two (or even more) background knowledges.
So, for a good wording, you should always apply the four-eyes principle.

## Think about so much more

Besides the above tasks, a good wording requires much more, e.g.:

- Keep in mind the length of your texts. If they are already long, how long will they possibly be in other languages?
- Differentiate between a technically correct wording and a wording the user will understand.

Before I sneaked into the session, I sometimes wondered how our UI-writers can discuss a whole hour about three or four keys.
Now I understand.
It's not just entering a word, it is so much more.
