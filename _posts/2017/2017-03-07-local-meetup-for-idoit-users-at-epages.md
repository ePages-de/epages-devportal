On February 16th 2017 the 12th local meetup of [i-doit](https://www.i-doit.com/){:target="_blank"} users (i-doit user meeting) took place in the [ePages](https://www.epages.com/en/){:target="_blank"} office in Jena.
i-doit is a tool for technical IT documentation.
ePages is using this tool for more than two years now.

The main part of the event was organized by [synetics GmbH](https://www.i-doit.com/en/company/){:target="_blank"} from Duesseldorf, Germany.
They also invited a representative from their partner [procilon](https://www.procilon.de/){:target="_blank"}.
The other attendees came from the [University of Jena](https://www.uni-jena.de/){:target="_blank"}, as well as from Erfurt, Leipzig, Dresden, and even Munich.

The event started with an interesting presentation at [Carl Zeiss AG](https://www.zeiss.de){:target="_blank"}.
Such a fringe event is meanwhile kind of a tradition for i-doit meetups.

The meetup itself was a nice mixture of reports on one's experiences accompanied by interesting discussions.
An extremely wide range from automation and API, object lists, services and reporting up to visualization and management of licenses or passwords demonstrates the multifarious fields of application i-doit is used for.
All participants agreed that it was a very nice meeting - not only because of the IT food: pizza ðŸ˜‰.

If you wonder how ePages started with i-doit take a look at the blog article [Creating systems with pipelining](/blog/tech-stories/creating-systems-with-pipelining/).
But step by step we are discovering other possible applications of i-doit.
One of our next projects will be the integration of monitoring using [Icinga](https://www.icinga.com/){:target="_blank"}.

Stay tuned - we'll keep you updated!
