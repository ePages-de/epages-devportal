For two days Scrum Masters, Product Owners and some representatives of developers met at ePages headquarter Hamburg to discuss about the status quo of how agile ePages is.
In particular, we clarified the roles of POs and SMs at ePages, we talked about learnings and what could be improved.

## First day

We started off in the morning with drawing so called "Role Maps".
In such a map, you draw your connections to other roles or groups in the company.
You also indicate, how much energy you dedicate into those connections and what's the benefit.
It was interesting to see, how different some connections of roles are at ePages, depending on the company location you are working at.

Afterwards, we quickly checked, how agile we think ePages is.
The agile coach, who moderated our agile hackathon, presented us the Agile Manifesto.
We voted from 1 (not true) to 10 (totally true) if we think that the four directives apply for ePages.
While we were pretty close together and agreed on a high number for "Working products are more important than documentation", our opinions differed with regards to the other three directives.
Here again, it depended on the team and the corresponding projects.
But in the total overview, we are on a pretty good way.

## Responsibilities

The afternoon was dedicated to really understand and agree on the responsibilities of the roles of Product Owners and Scrum Masters.
Since the views on the roles differed a lot depending on the company location, this caused some productive discussions.
In the end, we came up with the following definitions of the roles for ePages:

The second day began with a session about magic estimation.
Most of us already knew that, but it was a nice refreshment.
We also had short sessions about measuring the success of the Scrum Master work, impediment backlogs, transition team and pilot team.
The most important point on this day was to create a backlog of tasks we wanted to take out of the workshop.

### Backlog after the workshop

Here are the most important tasks we are going to tackle during the next weeks:

* Setting up a transition team
* Improve cooperation within the Scrum Master team (get a Scrum Master of Scrum Masters or coach from the outside)
* Find out, if we can create a pilot team as future lab at ePages
* Design Thinking workshops
* Servant leadership training for SMs, POs and Management
