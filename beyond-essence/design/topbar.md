The top bar is used to display the main actions of a page. The right side is used for buttons that have an impact on the current page content, the left side for more general actions.

The amount and order of the buttons and links can differ on particular pages.

## Structure

The top bar is characterized by the following elements:

* The sticky white area at the top of the page
* Primary action elements on the right side
* Secondary actions elements on the left side
* Flexible usage of the number of action elements
    

## Usage

* Place Primary/Secondary button and Cancel button on the right side: In the top bar as well as at [the bottom.](https://epages.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/~kmueller/pages/2397274278/Top+bar#The-bottom-bar "https://epages.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/~kmueller/pages/2397274278/Top+bar#The-bottom-bar")
    
* List _Save_ or _Add_ last in order to ‘end with the conclusion’ and in order to stay consistent with _Previous/Next_ buttons
    
* We do not use _Back_ buttons but _Cancel_ buttons.
    
* The wording for the three buttons mentioned is globally the same
    
* The top bar displays two different types of primary action elements:
    

### _Save_ button always comes with a _Cancel_ button

### _Add_ button always comes as a single button
{% image_custom image="/assets/img/pages/essence/Topbar - Add content - default.png" width="100" %}

### Top bar without primary action elements

If you create views where the user can’t add new content pages like products or marketing coupons you can use the top bar without primary action elements.

### View without top bar

Depending on your content and structure there can be the need to use the views without a top bar. This can happen if you want to guide the user through a landing page or dashboard.

## Secondary action elements

### _View your shop_ link

The _View your shop_ link is used in the top bar if the content in this view relates to the shop and website features. Use this link to give the user quick access to the customer’s web page.

### _Related apps_ link

Use this link to give the user quick access to the apps which relate to the content on this view. A pop-up will open where the user can activate or deactivate the application.

### Top bar without secondary action elements

The cockpit contains workspace areas where the user can set up a shop or website related content. Administrative settings that relate to the cockpit only don’t get a secondary action element. For example the ‘Account settings’ page

## The bottom bar

The bottom bar is only used in an edit view.

Place _Delete_ to the left bottom corner so that it is separated from the main buttons. It only appears after the user has been added/changed and then saved content for the first time.

## Design

The top bar comes with a white background, and a gray border on the bottom of the top bar to separate this area from the content area. The top bar has a fixed height of 73px and needs to be aligned always with the logo area in the sidebar.
