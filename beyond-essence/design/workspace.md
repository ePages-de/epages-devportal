The view in which the merchant interacts most is characterized through a pre-defined order of several UI elements:

* Top bar
* Breadcrumb
* Workspace title
* Workspace card
* Bottom bar
    
Not all elements are used at the same time. The most flexible UI element are the cards which can be placed in different layouts.

## Top bar

The top bar is used for action elements.

The counterpart to the bar on top is the bottom bar which contains almost the same elements as the top bar. With this pattern, we ensure that the user has short click ways.

## Breadcrumb

The breadcrumb is secondary navigation within a website. The breadcrumb navigation on the view offers users the option of finding their way back to the home page or quickly reaching other levels of the website in the form of internal links.

The breadcrumb is a mandatory element.

## Workspace title

Describe the content of the workspace as accurately as possible with as few words as possible.

The page title is never part of a card, but is standing on the top of all cards of this page!
