Our experience compass is the design directive for the development of the Commerce Cockpit user interface.
This compass is set of guidelines and generally applicable rules that serve as a starting point and vision for the creation of every new design.
In our work we strive for the following qualities and use them as shared vision to reach a common goal:

## Core

### Empowering

The Commerce Cockpit empowers our merchants to become successful with their business.
To enable merchants to make the right decisions, the Commerce Cockpit crew explains backgrounds and provides knowledge.
By communicating the interdependencies, merchants understand the importance of certain workflows and actions.

### Efficient

With our Commerce Cockpit we strive to support efficient and goal-oriented commerce workflows.
Merchants are able to complete recurring working routines quickly and without disturbances.
No matter if they run their business as a side project or full-time, the Commerce Cockpit allows them to work on tasks intuitively and with the least possible effort.
We make sure that our merchants can focus on their business, and that they are not distracted by obligatory tasks.

### Customized

Our merchants are diverse.
They have different business cases, sell a variety of products, come from various backgrounds, and have different levels of knowledge.
One cockpit that serves highly diverse needs and is suitable for different knowledge levels at the same time does not exist.
Our Commerce Cockpit adapts to the merchants' needs.
Each of them receives the function, the assistance, and the personalized suggestions they need in their current context and with their current knowledge level.

## Atmosphere

### Friendly, fresh, and bright

The cockpit provides a fresh and bright environment using corresponding colors, structures, and UI texts.
This ensures a friendly and positive prevailing mood which contributes to making our merchants' work pleasurable.

### Reduced and simple

The Commerce Cockpit is simple and straightforward.
The user interface does neither overwhelm the merchant, nor does it distract them from their tasks.
The content is presented by priority and always relevant for the merchant.
Design and language support the reduced and simple impression and form a unified experience. 

## Accompanying events

### Motivating and personal

We increase the motivation with an energetic and positive address.
Gamification elements illustrate the merchants' progress and success.
The merchants know that they are in good hands as the communication with the Commerce Cockpit crew always feels warm and personal.

### Joyful

The Commerce Cockpit is a work tool, but for merchants it doesn't feel like that.
Merchants have fun using the cockpit.
We regularly provide joyful moments, for example through joyous messages, illustrations, or animations, which surprise and motivate our merchants at the same time.

## How it all relates

The core describes the highest goals that the Commerce Cockpit strives for.
As the control center for the merchants' online business, it is empowering, efficient, and customized at all times to focus on their individual success.

This experience is embedded in an always prevailing, simple, and friendly working atmosphere.
It enables the merchant to achieve their goals in a positive and focused way.

What's more, the friendly working atmosphere is accentuated with motivating and joyful events.
These are well-dosed and perfectly matched to the working environment and the merchants' success.
That's a great way to support the merchants' satisfaction and make them happy in the long term.
