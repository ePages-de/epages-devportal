## UX wisdoms

### First understand the problem before trying to solve it

UX work should always have a purpose.
You should focus on adressing actual, and sometimes even urgent, problems that merchants or shop visitors are facing.
Make sure that you understand the core of the problem before spending time on developing a solution.
Try to estimate how critical the problem is.
Don't waste time solving trivial issues.

### Face it: you're not the user

What's obvious to you isn't necessarily obvious to someone else.
Our thought processes and the understanding of the world around us is affected by our genetics, upbringing, culture, and past experiences.
It is very unlikely, that the audience you're developing for thinks and behaves just like you.
Don't assume that you understand the needs of your customer by nature.

### Be empathic

Empathy means understanding and being sensitive to the feelings, thoughts, and experiences of another person.
In order to create a great usability for the products, take one step back and really try to see the world from the user's point of view.
Identify their needs.
And if you don't understand a specific requirement, go out and ask them, until you really got the point.
Only then you're able to improve the product and make the lives of your users easier.

## Interface conventions

### Keep the user informed

* Keep the users informed about what is going on through appropriate feedback in the UI within a reasonable timeframe.
* Don't let your users guess. Explain them where their action has led them to. For example, your users would appreciate a "Thank you" message and an order confirmation when they've completed a purchase.
* Keep the information process going: tell the users why they're waiting, why there's an error, praise them, offer them support.

### Be consistent and set value on standards

* No need to reinvent the wheel when it comes to UI standards. Users should recognize situations or actions and not have to wonder that words or processes differ from what they're used to.
* Make sure that navigation and structure throughout the product design are intuitive and reliable. When you deviate from the proven structures and user flows, this can be perceived incoherent, confusing, and unprofessional. Your users will start to question if they did something wrong or feel uncomfortable with the product. Consistency implies stability, and users want to feel like they're in good hands.

### Simplicity is beautiful

* Make sure that your product is easy to use, and that users intuitively find what they require for a specific use case. This avoids the user having to think too much, and they will love to use your product.

### Efficiency is king

* Make the user flow efficient to reduce effort on the user's side and demonstrate them respect at the same time.
