## Beyond users

All merchants have one shared intention in common:
_„I want to bring my idea to life.
I have the dream that one day, my idea will become a success.“_

Not primarily targeted are people with:
* Very clear growth ambitions incl. (possibly already done) investments
* No growth ambitions

### What users might say

_“From my first visit on, I want to feel to be in good hands. I want to be picked-up at where I stand and not delayed although my technical knowledge is not so high.”_

_“I want the system to be joyful and easy to use because I want to use it during my free time. I would not keep on using it if it frustrated me because my involvement in this project is not high enough yet."_

_“I dream of having success with this idea. Maybe I could even give up my main activity one day. This is why the software has to adapt to my requirements and growth.”_
