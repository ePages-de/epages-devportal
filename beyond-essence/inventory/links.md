Links are navigation elements.
They are interactive and give users access to further content that is not directly accessible via the primary navigation.

## Use cases

In the Beyond cockpit, we provide two types of links:

* Primary links
* Default links

Primary links are used for the recommended user action whereas default links have less importance and shouldn't be in the focus of the user's attention.

## Structure

Links are characterized by a certain color that stands out from the surrounding text color.

Depending on the use case or implementation, an icon can be displayed next to the link.
By adding an icon, the link and the its destination will be more self-explanatory.

If a default link is displayed in addition to a primary link, both links can either be located below each other or next to each other.

## Position

Links are positioned in various locations throughout the software:

* In tables

* In overviews

* In breadcrumbs

* In the pagination

* In the topbar

{% image_custom image="/assets/img/pages/essence/links-topbar.png" width="50" lightbox %}


They can also be included on cards, in settings layers, or in modal dialogs.
Here they can appear as followed:

* Embedded in text

* As stand-alone links

{% image_custom image="/assets/img/pages/essence/links-standalone.png" width="50" lightbox %}


## Behavior

Clicking or touching a link will open new content, e.g. a view, a popup, or a PDF document.
Depending on the use case or implementation, the content will be opened in a new tab, in the same tab, or in a desktop, or mobile application.

When hovering over a link, the color slightly changes to indicate that the user can interact with the element.

Exception: If, for design purposes, a link is used instead of a button, clicking or touching a link will also change, or delete data.

## Copy writing

Choose meaningful and descriptive labels that clearly describe the destination.
Users should directly understand where the link leads to without the need to read the context.

* Short and precise
* Meaningful and descriptive
* Avoid using punctuation at the end of the link

Exception: When referring to the Help center, we currently display whole sentences as a link that also contain a period at the end.

## Choosing between button and link

For some actions, either a button or a link might work.
The general guideline is that links are used to display further content, or to lead the user to a new destination.
In contrast, buttons are used if the action taken by the user changes data or requires interaction with the backend.

Exception: If a button would e.g. blow up a card or take away the focus from the primary button, a link is used in favor of a more structured, and user-friendly design.
