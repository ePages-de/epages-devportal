Links are navigation elements.
They are interactive and give users access to further content that is not directly accessible via the primary navigation.

## Use cases

In the Beyond cockpit, we provide various types of links:

* Links in tables and overviews

* Links with icons

* Stand-alone links

* Breadcrumb links

* Links embedded in text

* Pagination links

## Structure

Links are characterized by a certain color that stands out from the surrounding text color.
In exeptional cases, an icon is displayed next to the link.

## Position

Links are positioned in various locations throughout the software.
They are displayed

- on cards,
- in the topbar,
- and in tables.

## Behavior

Clicking or touching a link will open new content, e.g. a view, a popup, or a PDF document.
Depending on the use case or implementation, the content will be opened in a new tab, in the same tab, or in a new tool.

When hovering over a link, the color slightly changes to indicate that the user can interact with the element.

## Copy writing

Choose meaningful and descriptive labels that clearly describe the destination.
Users should directly understand where the link leads to without the need to read the context.

* Short and precise
* Meaningful and descriptive
* Avoid using punctuation at the end of the link

Exception: When referring to the Help center, we currently use whole sentences as a link that also contain a period at the end.

## Choosing between button and link

For some actions, either a button or a link might work.
The general guideline is that links are used to display further content, or to lead the user to a new destination.
In contrast, buttons are used if the action taken by the user changes data or requires interaction with the backend.

Exception: If a button would e.g. blow up a card or take away the focus from the primary button, a link is used in favor of a more structured, and user-friendly design.
