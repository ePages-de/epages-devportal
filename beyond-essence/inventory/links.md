Links are interactive and primarily navigational elements.
They give users access to further content that is not directly accessible via the primary navigation.

## Use cases

In the Beyond cockpit, links appear as various types:

* Links in tables and overviews

* Links with icons

{% image_custom image="/assets/img/pages/essence/links-with-icons.png" width="50" lightbox %}

* Stand-alone links

{% image_custom image="/assets/img/pages/essence/links-standalone.png" width="50" lightbox %}

* Breadcrumb links

{% image_custom image="/assets/img/pages/essence/links-breadcrumbs.png" width="50" lightbox %}

* Links embedded in text

{% image_custom image="/assets/img/pages/essence/links-embedded.png" width="50" lightbox %}

* Pagination links

{% image_custom image="/assets/img/pages/essence/links-pagination.png" width="50" lightbox %}


## Structure

Links are characterized by a certain color that stands out from the surrounding text color.
In exeptional cases, an icon is displayed next to the link.

## Position

Links are positioned in various locations throughout the software.
They are displayed

- on cards,
- in the topbar,
- and in tables.

## Behavior

Clicking or touching a link will open new content, e.g. a view, a popup, or a PDF document.
Depending on the use case or implementation, the content will be opened in a new tab, in the same tab, or in a new tool.

Interacting with links may also change how data is displayed on a view (e.g. when clicking or touching *view more*, *show all*). 


## Copy writing

Choose meaningful and descriptive labels that clearly describe the destination.
Users should directly understand where the link leads to without the need to read the context.
Do not use punctuation at the end of the link unless the link is embedded in a text.

## Choosing between button and link

For some actions, either a button or a link might work.
The general guideline is that links are used to display further content, or to lead the user to a new destination.
In contrast, buttons are used if the action taken by the user changes data or requires interaction with the backend.

Nevertheless, there are exceptions to this guideline in favor of a more structured, and user-friendly design.
This can be the case if the use of a button would e.g. blow up a card or take away the focus from the primary button.
