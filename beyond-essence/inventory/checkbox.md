# Checkbox

The checkbox is part of the group of selection controls.
It allows the user to select and unselect one or multiple specific options.

## Behavior

A checkbox consists of the box itself as well as one label.
* The box can can whether have a checked or unchecked status.
* The label is located on the right side of the checkbox.

{% image_custom image="/assets/img/pages/essence/checkbox_05.png" align="center" caption="Unchecked status" width="10" %} {% image_custom image="/assets/img/pages/essence/checkbox_06.png" align="center" caption="Checked status" width="10" %}

Depending on the specific checkbox, further features can appear

Example 1
{% image_custom image="/assets/img/pages/essence/checkbox_01.png" align="center" width="30" %}
{% image_custom image="/assets/img/pages/essence/checkbox_02.png" align="center" width="40" %}

Example 2
{% image_custom image="/assets/img/pages/essence/checkbox_03.png" align="center" width="50" %}
{% image_custom image="/assets/img/pages/essence/checkbox_04.png" align="center" width="50" %}

## Wording

* Use positive and active wording for checkbox labels, so that it’s clear what will happen if the user turns on the checkbox.
* Avoid negations such as “Don’t send me more emails,” which would mean that the user would have to check the box in order for something not to happen.

## Design

Coming soon.
