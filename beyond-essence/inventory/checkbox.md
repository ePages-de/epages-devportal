**Use Positive Wording For Checkbox Label**

Use positive and active wording for checkbox labels, so that it’s clear what will happen if the user turns on the checkbox. Avoid negations such as “Don’t send me more email,” which would mean that the user would have to check the box in order for something not to happen.
