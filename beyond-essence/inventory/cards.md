Cards are visual elements that are used to group relating pieces of information into one compact and manageable unit.

## Use cases

Cards are used to display various information on a superordinate topic.

In the Beyond cockpit we provide two types of cards:

* Standard cards

{% image_custom image="/assets/img/pages/essence/cards-standard.png"  width="100" lightbox %}

* Cards with title

{% image_custom image="/assets/img/pages/essence/cards-title.png"  width="100" lightbox %}

* Cards for topic clustering

{% image_custom image="/assets/img/pages/essence/cards-cluster.png"  width="100" lightbox %}

## Structure

Cards resemble physical cards.
They are characterized by a rectangular format that clearly stands out from the background.
Cards can differ in width.

Standard cards come without title and group pieces of relating information using UI elements.
Cards with title have the same structure as standard cards but come with a title at the very top.

Depending on where the cards appear, they can have a one-column grid (as shown in "Use cases") or two-column grid:

{% image_custom image="/assets/img/pages/essence/cards-two-columns.png"  width="100" lightbox %}

Cards for topic clustering stand out from the above mentioned structure with regards to the amount and allocation of text as well as the UI elements used.

## Position

Cards are positioned on a view and are the main elements to display information in the UI.

## Behavior

The user cannot interact with the card itself, just with the UI elements on it.
Thus, cards don't have a specific behavior.

## Copy writing

Title of a card:

* Meaningful
* Gives a summary of what the content of the card is about
* Not too wordy

## Design
