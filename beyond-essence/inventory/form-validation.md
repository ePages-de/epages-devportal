title: Form validation

Form validation is an important part of guiding a user through entry fields.
Provide the merchant with helpful and properly formatted information to make clear which fields are incorrect and why.

Use inline validation to immediately inform the user about success or failure of the provided data.

## Design

Form validation is presented via a red vertical line on the left side of each mandatory input field. An additional validation hint is positioned below the input field. It comes with a red background and white text, and in addition has an arrow to visualise the communion between input field and validation message.
