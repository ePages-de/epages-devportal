Ribbons are graphical elements and are used on UI elements to mark, highlight, or emphasize something.

## Use cases

In the Beyond cockpit ribbons are used as labels to mark a function, such as an active theme, a test order, or a canceled order.

## Structure

Ribbons can either be attached to a content segment or appear as a label being attached to a UI element.
The size and outline of the ribbon can vary.

## Position

Ribbons appear at the top of a UI element.
The side and allocation of the ribbon can vary.

Right side, two ribbons next to each other:

{% image_custom image="/assets/img/pages/essence/ribbons-right.png"  width="50" lightbox %}

Left side, one ribbon with icon:

{% image_custom image="/assets/img/pages/essence/ribbons-left.png"  width="50" lightbox %}

## Behavior

Ribbons are static.
