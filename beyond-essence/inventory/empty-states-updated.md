Examples of where empty states should be present include a table or list with no entries or a search result page with no results. Empty order tables or graphs can be depressing and demotivating, so we want to use empty states to a) guide the merchant on what to do next, b) avoid confusion on the merchant’s end and c) motivate and encourage the merchant at the beginning of their journey.

## Structure

An empty state should include:

* A headline that briefly describes the state or the action that can be taken
* A text that conveys the purpose of the page and explains what the merchant can do next
* A CTA button that links to the next action (if there is a logical next action)
* An illustration matching the theme of the page
* A link to the corresponding help center article

## Copywriting

Empty states can have a more experimental and personal design and language.
We'd love to see positive empty states.

The intention of the wording on empty state pages depends on the kind of empty state the merchant is seeing:

**Only appears once**,  e.g. when fields have to be filled:

* Motivate the merchant to take action
* Explain how to take action

_Example_:
Marketing coupons: The empty state motivates the merchant to create their first campaign and links to the Help Center for more information.

**Cannot be changed by simple action**, e.g. results that depend on the sales performance. 

* Explain what should be here or will be here soon.
* Motivate the merchant to check back later to see what’s new or take an alternative action in the meantime.

_Example (App overview)_:
There are currently no apps available here.
As soon as new apps become available, you'll see them here.
Check in at a later time to see what's new!
