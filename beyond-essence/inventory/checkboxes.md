Checkboxes belong to the selection controls and are used to enable or disable action items.
They allow the user to make a concious choice for or against an action.
Checkboxes may also serve as an indicator to agree to specific terms and conditions.

## Use cases

With checkboxes we allow the user activate or deactivate a function.

## Structure

Checkboxes are characterized by a checkbox icon, that is either enabled or disabled.
An enabled checkbox comes with a green checkmark icon, whereas a disabled checkbox is just a beige box icon.
The UI label is in any case on the right side of the checkbox.

## Position

Checkboxes may be positioned on a card together with further UI elements that relate to a specific feature.

## Behavior

A checkbox can either have an enabled or disabled status.

Checkboxes may either simply activate or deactivate a function:

{% image_custom image="/assets/img/pages/essence/checkbox-simple.gif" width="100" %}

Or depending on the feature, further functions may appear:

{% image_custom image="/assets/img/pages/essence/checkbox-complex.gif" width="100" %}

## Copy writing

Reduced and efficient.

* Concise. Keep the UI label short and sweet.

```
On offer
Purchasable
Filter by price
```

Avoid negations, as the merchant would have to select the checkbox for something not to happen:

```
Don’t send me more emails
```

## Choosing between switch button and checkbox

For some actions, either a switch button or a checkbox might work.
To decide which component would work better, here are some clues:

* Use a switch button for binary settings when actions become effective immediately after the user made them.
* Use a switch button if the feature has a significant effect on the users work and further work steps.
* Use checkboxes when the user can select multiple items that are related to a single setting or feature.
* Use checkboxes for optional or additional items.
* Use a checkbox when the user has to perform extra steps for changes to be effective.
