Checkboxes belong to the selection controls and are used to enable or disable functions.
They allow the user to make a concious choice to use or not to use a specific function.

## Use cases

With checkboxes we allow the user activate or deactivate a function.

## Structure

Checkboxes are characterized by a checkbox icon, that is either enabled or disabled.
The UI label is in any case on the right side of the checkbox.

## Position

Checkboxes are positioned on a card together with further UI elements that relate to a specific function.

{% image_custom image="/assets/img/pages/essence/checkbox-card.png" width="100" %}

If a merchant enables a checkbox, the new function will appear below:

{% image_custom image="/assets/img/pages/essence/checkbox-below.png" width="100" %}

If the checkbox is to represent an extended function of a higher-level element, it is set at a close distance to this element.
This emphasizes that the action of the checkbox refers to the previous element.
In this example, the new function is displayed on the right:

{% image_custom image="/assets/img/pages/essence/checkbox-aside.png" width="100" %}

## Behavior

A checkbox can either have an enabled or disabled status, and can either activate or deactivate a function:

{% image_custom image="/assets/img/pages/essence/checkbox-simple.gif" width="100" %}

Or depending on the feature, further functions may appear:

{% image_custom image="/assets/img/pages/essence/checkbox-complex.gif" width="100" %}

## Copy writing

Reduced and efficient.

* Concise. Keep the UI label short and sweet.

```
On offer
Purchasable
Filter by price
```

Avoid negations, as the merchant would have to select the checkbox for something not to happen:

```
Donâ€™t send me more emails
```

## Choosing between switch button and checkbox

For some actions, either a switch button or a checkbox might work.
To decide which component would work better, here are some clues:

* Use a switch button for binary settings when actions become effective immediately after the user made them.
* Use a switch button if the feature has a significant effect on the users work and further work steps.
* Use checkboxes when the user can select multiple items that are related to a single setting or feature.
* Use checkboxes for optional or additional items.
* Use a checkbox when the user has to perform extra steps for changes to be effective.

## Design

An enabled checkbox comes with a white checkmark icon on a green background, whereas a disabled checkbox is just a beige-outlined box.
