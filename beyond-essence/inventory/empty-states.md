Empty states can have a more experimental and personal design and language.

We'd love to see positive empty states.

Distinguish between different empty states:

**Only appears once**, e.g. when fields have to be filled.
Example: Product overview > motivate the merchant to actively create the first product.

**Cannot be changed by simple action**, e.g. results that depend on the sales performance.
Example: Orders > support the merchant with a successful business.
Don't: Cheeky phrases such as "Looks pretty empty here."

**Particularly short**, e.g.
Example: Product detail page > collection list
