Radio buttons belong to the selection controls and allow users to select a single option from a list.

## Use cases

In the Beyond cockpit we provide three types of radio buttons:

* Radio buttons that allow to select from a list of options

* Radio buttons that relate to input fields

* Radio buttons that open content

{% image_custom image="/assets/img/pages/essence/radio-buttons-open.gif" width="100" lightbox %}

Radio buttons are used throughout the UI, if:

* there is a list of two or more options
* we want the user to view all available options at a glance 
* we want to allow for quick comparison

## Structure

Radio buttons are characterized by a small circle that are filled or highlighted when selected or remain as a circle in an inactive status. 
The UI label is in any case on the right side of the radio button.

## Position

Radio buttons are positioned on a card together with further UI elements that relate to a specific function.
As the user chooses from several options: the lesser options available the better they can be displayed via radio buttons.
The buttons should be listed in a logical order, such as "likely to least likely" or "simplest to "most complex".

## Behavior

By default always one of the several radio buttons is selected, i.e. the most commonly option used.
Only one radio button can be selected at the same time.
Selecting one radio button automatically deactivates the previously selected one.

Radio buttons change settings and do not perform commands.
Only if the user confirms the selection with a command, such as "Save", the changes will take effect.

As radio buttons are quite tiny, it's hard to click or tap them.
The UI supports the user with an enlarged target area, so that they can even click or touch the UI label.

## Copy writing

Clearly describe the choice that the user makes when they decide for the option.
Label the radio button with the setting that is applied when the user chooses the option.
