Toast messages briefly provide feedback about an action through a short message.
Merchants are quickly informed about important actions that they or the system performed.

## Use cases

In the Beyond cockpit we provide three types of toast messages:

* Success. Appears if an action or operation was successfully completed.
* Information. Appears if an event occurred.
* Error. Appears in case of errors.

## Structure

Toast messages are characterized by the following elements:

* an icon indicating the message type
* a short sentence stating the feedback for the merchant
* optional: the next action.

## Position

Toast messages appear at the upper right corner of the screen.

## Behavior

* Toast messages fly into the screen from the right side.
* Multiple toast messages are displayed one below the other.

Depending on the type of message, notifications disappear automatically or have to be actively closed by the merchant.

* Success messages automatically disappear after XX seconds.
* Information messages automatically disappear after XX seconds.
* Error messages are displayed until the error has been resolved.

## Copy writing

Reduced and efficient.

* Concise. Keep the content short and sweet.
* Precise. Put your message in a nutshell.
* Neutral. Get the message across in a factual, but not emotional style.
