## Interface content

Well-thought through interface content is a key element for a user-friendly software product.
Our content standards will assist you when preparing interface content for our software, help you to convey meaning, and provide clarity for our merchants.

Each [inventory element](/beyond-essence/inventory/) also comes with content guidelines about how to write for a specific element.

## Make our merchants happy

Not everyone is a gifted content writer.
But sure you can try and step into the shoes of ePages merchants, and make sure your content best meets their requirements.
Show them that you're familiar with their situation, by making the interface texts easy to understand, and thus the software easy to use.

## These tips come in handy

With `beyond-essence` we aim to introduce texts that are understandable by anyone, anywhere, regardless of their cultural background, or language.

Clear, accurate, and concise text makes interfaces more usable, and build trust.
We've composed some basic text standards that guide you through this.

* [Language and Tone](/beyond-essence/content/language-tone/)
* [Spelling and Punctuation](/beyond-essence/content/spelling-punctuation/)
* [Grammar](/beyond-essence/content/grammar/)
