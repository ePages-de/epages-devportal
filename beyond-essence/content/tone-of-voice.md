## What is tone of voice?

With a positive and cheerful tone of voice we want to ensure that everywhere in our software, and in every communication with ePages our merchants feel comfortable and in good hands.
For example, if a merchant successfully went through the onboarding steps and finally opened their shop, they might feel happy, excited, and relieved, but also a bit unsure what the next steps will be.
We can respond to this by celebrating them and telling them what to do next.

When a merchant receives an error message, they might feel alarmed and insecure what to do about it and how to solve the issue.
We can support them by explaining what caused the error and how to continue.
We always want to be supportive with our merchants and never frightening them.

## Best practices

Here are some examples we use throughout our software:

#### In-app messages

A merchant just added their 10th product to their product range. We'd like to celebrate this and motivate them:

*Hooray! ðŸŽ‰ Youâ€™ve just added the 10th product to your product range. Thatâ€™s just the right way! High five! ðŸ™Œ
P.S. Take a look at the articles about products in the Beyond Help Center.*

A merchant is done with the first online shop setup steps and is actively using their cockpit. We'd like to improve the software in order to meet their needs best possible. Receiving their feedback would be great:

*Hi Tina,
You've been using your Commerce Cockpit for a while now. That's great! ðŸ¤—
We would be grateful if you could give us a moment of your time to share your first impressions with us.
Did you like something in particular? What can we do to make Beyond even easier to use?*

A merchant just opened their online shop. Time to celebrate and give them further advice:

*Weâ€™re thrilled! Youâ€™ve opened your shop for customers. We are curious when the first orders will come in. ðŸ’°ðŸ’°ðŸ’°
Are you already familiar with Search Engine Optimization (SEO)? Ask the Internet about it.*
