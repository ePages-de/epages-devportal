## Formatting

### Structured and simple

- Keep the overall appearance structured and simple.
- Use the _Standard_ font size for general text sections.
- Use the predefined header sizes starting with _Header 2_.
- Use **bold** formatting for elements that the user has to select, e.g. buttons, checkboxes, menu items, or radio buttons.
- Use _italic_ formatting for elements that are mentioned to navigate the user, e.g. cards, views, and input fields.

## Layout 

### Visuals

- Use images and screenshots to support explanations and instructions.
- To highlight an area, add a light grey overlay to the image and cut out the area that is currently relevant.

- To refer to certain elements in an image, use numbers.

### Info boxes

Use info boxes to give further reading hints by linking to related articles.

**Configuration:**

- Format the text itself as _Paragraph_.
- Write the headline (_Info_) in bold.
- Do not add a punctuation mark behind the headline.

{% image_custom image="/assets/img/pages/essence/info-box1.png" width="50" %}

{% image_custom image="/assets/img/pages/essence/info-box2.png" width="50" %}

**Implementation:**

en-US: `<div class="info"><strong>Info</strong><br />[...]</div>`   
de-DE: `<div class="info"><strong>Info</strong><br />[...]</div>`   

In each case, [...] is a placeholder for the respective text you'd like to add to the box.

### Note boxes

Use note boxes to give relevant information that is useful for the current context but that is not necessary to perform an action. It can e.g. be used to 

- explain the impact of the action,
