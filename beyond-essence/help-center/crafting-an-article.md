## General guidelines

- Stick to our [language](/beyond-essence/content/language/), [grammar](/beyond-essence/content/grammar/), and [spelling and punctuation](/beyond-essence/content/spelling-punctuation/) guidelines.
- Comply with our [tone of voice](https://developer.epages.com/beyond-essence/content/tone-of-voice/).

## Start from zero

- See the software through the eyes of a merchant.
- Test the feature you'll describe in the software.
- Search for background information that will help the merchant.

## Mention the elements

- Explicitly mention the element the merchant needs to interact with, e.g. a checkbox or a card. 
- Exception: Only mention the element _button_ if it's absolutely necessary to understand the sentence.
Otherwise, just write the button label in bold.

## Display icons

- Add screenshots of icons as they are used in the software instead of naming them.
