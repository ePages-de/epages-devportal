If all help articles are structured in a similar way, the user can find the required information more easily and faster.

### Give an overview of the content

The user should directly know what an article is about.
So, add a table of content to all articles that have more than one headline (excluding "Related articles").

Introduce this table with _Skip to_.

{% image_custom image="/assets/img/pages/essence/skip-to.png" width="50" %}

### Promote further readings

The Help center guides the users through the process of setting up their online business and clarifies their questions.
To improve this guidance, add useful articles as a _Related articles_ section at the end of an article.

{% image_custom image="/assets/img/pages/essence/related-articles.png" width="50" %}

You can add all articles that are somehow connected to the article, and that you'd like to recommend to the user.
But if you've already mentioned an article with it's full name in a short article, don't repeat it in the _Related articles_ section.
In this case, only add articles that are not mentioned with their full name or new ones.
For longer articles or for articles where users will most likely skip to certain parts of the article, you can repeat the article in the _Related articles_ section.

If there are no related articles, omit this section.
