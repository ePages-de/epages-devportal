### Explain the goal

- Start an article by telling the user what the article is about.
- Add a table of content to all articles that have more than one headline (excluding "Related articles").
- Introduce the table of content with _Skip to_.

### Promote further readings

- Add all articles that are somehow connected to an article as a _Related articles_ section at the end of the article.
- If you've already mentioned an article with it's full name in a short article, don't repeat it in the _Related articles_ section (unless for longer articles or for articles where users will most likely skip to certain parts of the article).
- If there are no related articles, omit this section.
