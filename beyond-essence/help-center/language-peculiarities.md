Concerning [language](/beyond-essence/content/language/), [grammar](/beyond-essence/content/grammar/), and [spelling and punctuation](/beyond-essence/content/spelling-punctuation/) we stick to the guidelines that we've already mentioned in _Content_.
The [tone of voice](https://developer.epages.com/beyond-essence/content/tone-of-voice/) is also applied to our Help center.

Apart from that, there are some aspects you additionally need to keep in mind when writing help articles.

## Mention the element you are referring to

To give the users a better overview of where they are and what they have to do next, explicitly mention the element they need to interact with, e.g a checkbox or a switch button.

Here are some examples:

- Select the checkbox **On offer**.
- Activate the switch button **Track stock level**.
- On the card _Basics_ in the field _Internal name_, enter a name that defines your shipping zone.
- Check the _Shipping_ column.
- When selecting an order from the view _Orders_, you have the possibility to edit the shipping status of this respective order.

Buttons are an exception to this rule.
Only mention the element _button_ if it's absolutely necessary to understand the sentence.
Otherwise, just write the button label in bold:

- Select **Save**.
- Select **Publish**.
- On the top right, select **Add product**.

## Display icons instead of naming them

Every user has a different background and a different perception of icons.
That's why we do not name icons, e.g. "truck icon", or "gears icon".
Instead, we add a screenshot of the icon as it's used in the software:

{% image_custom image="/assets/img/pages/essence/icon-example.png" width="50" %}


## Consider language specific requirements

Besides the general guidelines for the Help center, each language has it's own characteristics and requirements that you need to have in mind when writing help articles.

### English (en-GB)

**General information**

**Grammar**

**Terminology**

- As our users browse on laptops as well as on smartphones and tablets, do not use a "computer specific language". E.g. use "select" or "navigate" instead of "click", "hover with your mouse over..".
- In many articles, we need to guide the users to the view in which they need to take their actions. Depending on the view, the navigation can include more than one step. In this case, describe the required path like this: "In the sidebar of the cockpit, navigate to **Products > Product overview**."
