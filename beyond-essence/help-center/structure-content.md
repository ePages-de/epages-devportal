## Structure

If all help articles are structured in a similar way, the user can find the required information more easily and faster.

### Give an overview of the content

The user should directly know what an article is about.
That's why we add a table of content to all articles that have more than one headline (excluding "Related articles").

This table of content is introduced with _Skip to_.

### Promote further readings

We should guide the users through the process of setting up their online business and clarifying their questions.
To do so, we add useful articles as a _Related articles_ section at the end of an article.

You can add all articles that are somehow connected to the article, and that you'd like to recommend to the user.
But if you've already mentioned an article with it's full name in a short article, don't repeat it in the _Related articles_ section.
In this case, only add articles that are not mentioned with their full name or new ones in there.
For long articles or for articles where users will most likely skip to certain parts of an article, you can repeat the article in the _Related articles_ section.

If there are no related articles, this section can be omitted.  

## Language 

Concerning [language](/beyond-essence/content/language/), [grammar](beyond-essence/content/grammar/), and [spelling and punctuation](/beyond-essence/content/spelling-punctuation/) we mostly stick to the guidelines that are already mentioned in _Content_.
The [tone of voice](https://developer.epages.com/beyond-essence/content/tone-of-voice/) is also applied to the Help center.

### Mention the element you are referring to

To give the user a better overview of where he is and what he needs to do, mention the element the user needs to interact with.
Here are some examples:

- Select the checkbox **On offer**.
- Activate the switch button **Track stock level**.
- On the card _Basics_ in the field _Internal name_, enter a name that defines your shipping zone.
- Check the _Shipping_ column.
- When selecting an order from the view _Orders_, you have the possibility to edit the shipping status of this respective order.

The only exception to this are buttons. In this case, the element itself should only be explicitly mentioned if it's absolutely necessary to understand the sentence. Otherwise, just use the button label in bold:

- Select **Save**.
- Select **Publish**.
- On the top right, select **Add product**.

### Display icons instead of naming them

Every user has a different background and a different perception of icons.
That's why it's hard to name icons, e.g. "truck icon", or "gears icon".
Instead, add the image of the icon as it's used in the software.
